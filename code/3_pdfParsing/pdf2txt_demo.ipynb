      "The Guidelines and Protocols Advisory Committee’s (GPAC) mandate is to support both the effective\n",
      "utilization of medical services and high quality, appropriate patient care. This is achieved through the\n",
      "development, publication and promotion of clinical practice guidelines and protocols. GPAC’s clinical practice\n",

      "16. How long has GPAC existed?\n",
      "The origin of GPAC traces back to the 1993 Working Agreement. This Agreement called for the establishment\n",
      "of the BC Council on Clinical Practice Guidelines (the Council) and the Protocol Steering Committee (the\n",
      "Committee). The Council was responsible for developing clinical practice guidelines for the MSC, while the\n",
      "Committee was responsible for implementing payment protocols for the BC health care system.\n",
      "BC Council on Clinical Practice Guidelines: The Council’s mandate was to reduce expenditures on ineffective\n",
      "or inappropriate medical interventions, while maintaining or improving the quality of medical care and access\n",
      "to medically required services. It first met in June 1994, though it was not established as an advisory\n",
      "committee to MSC until July 7, 1995 (MOC #1118). Their first clinical practice guideline X-Ray for Acute Ankle\n",
      "Injury was approved in December 1995, and between March 1996 and January 1997, six more clinical\n",
      "practice guidelines and patient guides were published.\n",
      "Protocol Steering Committee: The Committee’s mandate was to develop protocols that maintain or improve\n",
      "the quality of medical care and access to medical services, while making optimal use of medical resources. It\n",
      "was established by the MSC on July 12, 1995 (MOC #1130) and first met in August 1995. Their first protocol\n",
      "Protocol for Routine Pre-Operative Testing and the Standard Pre-Operative Outpatient Diagnostic Requisition\n",
      "Form was approved in December 1996. Between December 1996 and March 1999, the Committee published\n",
      "18 protocols.\n",
      "However, as early as 1996, the Council had expressed concern over the lack of coordination between the\n",
      "Council and the Committee, potentially causing conflict and the duplication of effort. In April 1997, the MSC\n",
      "established the Protocols/Guidelines Steering Committee (MOC #97-027) to address continuous\n",
      "improvement in the process of protocol and guideline development, but challenges remained. The BCMA\n",
      "(now known as DOBC) Board of Directors and Executive had recommended that one organization, with added\n",
      "members, should be responsible for both protocols and guidelines during the same time period. By April\n",
      "1999, the Council dissolved with a masse resignation of its members.\n",

      "Clinical practice guidelines are recommendations based on scientific evidence and expert clinical opinion.\n",

      "clinical circumstances. In this way, guideline recommendations reflect evidence on what constitutes best\n",

      "2. Why do we need clinical practice guidelines?\n",
      "Clinical practice guidelines represent the best medical guidance for clinical decision-making and encourage\n",
      "the provision of only medically necessary services that have proven benefits to patients in specific situations.\n",
      "The use of guidelines is not new. What is new, however, is the drive to base practice recommendations on a\n",

      "       decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances.\n",
      "     Protocols are a precise outline for the study of a biomedical problem or for a regimen of therapy.\n",

      "There are a variety of challenges involved in developing clinical practice guidelines, including:1,2\n",

      "     confusion caused by conflicting guidelines;\n",

      "1. Will guidelines interfere with a patients’ access to certain services?\n",
      "Clinical practice guidelines are not designed to replace physicians’ clinical judgement in deciding upon\n",
      "appropriate medical interventions for their patients; nor do they compromise physicians’ rights and\n",
      "obligations to practice medicine with diligence in determining the appropriate medical care for his or her\n",
      "patient. Rather, guidelines present current medical evidence in a concise document that physicians and\n",
      "patients can refer to with confidence.\n",
      "2. Will clinical practice guidelines change patients’ coverage under the BC Medical\n",
      "Service Plan (MSP)?\n",
      "No, coverage will not change as a result of clinical practice guidelines. Since being implemented, the MSP has\n",
      "provided coverage for all medically required services in order to meet the “comprehensiveness” requirement\n",
      "of the Canada Health Act.\n",
      "The key phrase is “medically necessary”, which may be defined as a service that is effective and appropriate\n",
      "for a specific circumstance. In the past, it has been unclear whether a service is considered medically\n",
      "necessary. Therefore, different practitioners tend to use different rules. Clinical practice guidelines clarify\n",
      "what is and is not a medically necessary service for certain clinical circumstances based on scientific evidence\n",
      "and expert medical opinion. So while guidelines do not change coverage under the MSP, they do assist\n",
      "practitioners and patients in making health care decisions and subsequently, help improve the\n",
      "appropriateness and effectiveness of care provided to BC patients.\n",
      "3. If, according to a guideline, a patient does not require a particular service but\n",
      "wishes to obtain it anyways, will the service be paid by the MSP?\n",
      "The MSP only pays for services that are considered benefits under the plan, which are generally confined to\n",
      "medically necessary services. Patients requesting services that are determined by their physician to not be\n",
      "medically necessary should expect to pay for these services themselves.\n",
      "                                                        22\n",

      "5. How can clinical practice guidelines save the BC health care system money?\n",
      "Studies have shown a significant number of tests, treatments and procedures are unnecessary, inappropriate\n",
      "or ineffective. For example, we know that for ankle injury, the number of unnecessary x-rays outnumber\n",
      "appropriate x-rays. The BC guideline X-ray for Acute Ankle Injury, based on the Ottawa Ankle Rules, resulted\n",
      "in a reduction in the number of ankle x-rays performed annually. Apart from improving the quality and\n",
      "consistency of care, and reducing unnecessary patient exposure to radiation, the reduction in overall volume\n",
      "of x-rays will save money that can then be made available for better use elsewhere.\n",
      "Alternatively, there may be instances when a guideline will result in increased costs. The overall goal of\n",
      "guidelines is to improve the quality of care by guaranteeing that individuals receive the most effective and\n",
      "appropriate medical interventions for their specific circumstances.\n",
