Neutropenia: Fever or other evidence of infection must be assessed promptly and treated aggressively. 2. Cardiac Toxicity: DOXOrubicin is cardiotoxic and must be used with caution, if at all, in patients with severe hypertension or cardiac dysfunction. Cardiac assessment is recommended if lifelong dose of 450 mg/m 2 to be exceeded. (BC Cancer Drug Manual) 3. Extravasation: DOXOrubicin and vinCRIStine cause pain and tissue necrosis if extravasated. Refer to BC Cancer Extravasation Guidelines. 4. Hypersensitivity: If applicable, monitor etoposide infusion for the first 15 minutes for signs of hypotension. Refer to BC Cancer Hypersensitivity Guidelines. riTUXimab can cause allergic type reactions during the IV infusion such as hypotension, wheezing, rash, flushing, alarm, pruritus, sneezing, cough, fever or faintness. For first dose, patients are to be under constant visual observation during all dose increases and for 30 minutes after infusion is completed. For all subsequent doses, constant visual observation is not required. Vital signs are not required unless symptomatic. Because transient hypotension may occur during infusion, consider withholding antihypertensive medications 12 hours prior to riTUXimab infusion. If an allergic reaction occurs, stop the infusion and the physician in charge should determine a safe time and rate to resume the infusion. A reasonable guideline is as follows. After recovery of symptoms, restart riTUXimab infusion at one infusion rate below the rate at which the reaction occurred and continue with escalation of infusion rates on the appropriate schedule above. If the infusion must be stopped a second time, restart after clearance of symptoms, at one infusion rate lower and continue at that rate without further escalation. Fatal cytokine release syndrome can occur (see below). See BC Cancer Hypersensitivity Guidelines. 5. Fatal Cytokine Release Syndrome has been reported. It usually occurs within 1-2 hours of initiating the first infusion. Initially, it is characterised by severe dyspnea (often with bronchospasm and hypoxia) in addition to fever, chills, rigors, urticaria and angioedema. Pulmonary interstitial infiltrates or edema visible on chest x-ray may accompany acute respiratory failure. There may be features of tumour lysis syndrome such as hyperuricemia, hypocalcemia, acute renal failure and elevated LDH. For severe reactions, stop the infusion immediately and evaluate for tumour lysis syndrome and pulmonary infiltration. Aggressive symptomatic treatment is required. The infusion can be resumed at no more than one-half the previous rate once all symptoms have resolved, and laboratory values and chest x-ray findings have normalized. The risk of cytokine release syndrome is low but is increased when the peripheral blood lymphocyte count is greater than 30 to 50 x 10 9 /L. While there is no requirement to withhold riTUXimab based on lymphocyte count, clinicians may wish to pre-medicate\\t', '\\tBC Cancer Protocol Summary LYCHOPRMTX Page 7 of 9 Activated: 1 Jun 2014 Revised: 1 Feb 2018 (Minor typo corrected)\\t', \"\\tWarning: The information contained in these documents are a statement of consensus of BC Cancer professionals regarding their views of currently accepted approaches to treatment.

Rare Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions: (similar to Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) have been anecdotally reported. If such a reaction occurs, riTUXimab should be discontinued. 7. Hepatitis B Reactivation: All lymphoma patients should be tested for both HBsAg and HBcoreAb. If either test is positive, such patients should be treated with lamiVUDine during chemotherapy and for six months afterwards. Such patients should also be monitored with frequent liver function tests and hepatitis B virus DNA at least every two months. If the hepatitis B virus DNA level rises during this monitoring, management should be reviewed with an appropriate specialist with experience managing hepatitis and consideration given to halting chemotherapy. 8. Gastrointestinal Obstruction or Perforation: There have been rare reports of gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation, sometimes fatal, when riTUXimab is given in combination with other chemotherapy, occurring 1 to 12 weeks after treatment. Symptoms possibly indicative of such complications should be carefully investigated and appropriately treated. 9. Third space fluids: Patients with clinically or radiologically detectable third space fluid (e.g. pleural effusion, ascites, full extremity pitting edema) should NOT be given high dose methotrexate. 10. Renal elimination: Patients with elevated serum creatinine or calculated GFR (or CrCl) below 60 mL/min should NOT receive high dose methotrexate. Avoid concomitant use of drugs that may inhibit renal elimination of methotrexate such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), salicylates and sulfa drugs. 11. Possible interactions with proton pump inhibitors (e.g. pantoprazole, omeprazole, lansoprazole) have been reported, resulting in elevated methotrexate levels and increased risk of methotrexate toxicity. Consider discontinuing proton pump inhibitors 1 day prior to methotrexate administration. If their use if required, closely monitor methotrexate levels and monitor for signs of methotrexate toxicity. 12. Possible interaction with penicillins (e.g., amoxicillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin). Penicillins compete with methotrexate for excretion sites in the renal tubules resulting in increased serum methotrexate and toxicity. Primarily a concern with high-dose methotrexate and thus the combination should be avoided if possible. 13. Medication Safety: riTUXimab is formulated differently for IV versus subcutaneous administration. Use caution during prescribing, product selection, preparation and administration. IV formulation is supplied as 10 mg/mL solution which must be diluted prior to administration. Subcutaneous formulation is supplied as a fixed dose of 1400 mg/11.7 mL ready-to-use solution which contains hyaluronidase to facilitate injection. 14. Increased drug absorption by hyaluronidase: other subcutaneous medications should not be injected at the same site as subcutaneous riTUXimab. Increased systemic effects are unlikely to be clinically significant with topical applications of EMLA, hydrocortisone, or diphenhydrAMINE.\\t', '\\tCall Dr. Diego Villa at (604) 877-6000 or 1-800-663-3333 with any problems or questions regarding this treatment program.\\t', \"\\t1.

Initially, it is characterized by severe dyspnea (often with bronchospasm and hypoxia) in addition to fever, chills, rigors, urticaria and angioedema. Pulmonary interstitial infiltrates or edema visible on chest x-ray may accompany acute respiratory failure. There may be features of tumour lysis syndrome such as hyperuricemia, hypocalcemia, acute renal failure and elevated LDH. For severe reactions, stop the infusion immediately and evaluate for tumour lysis syndrome and pulmonary infiltration. Aggressive symptomatic treatment is required. The infusion can be resumed at no more than one-half the previous rate once all symptoms have resolved, and laboratory values and chest x-ray findings have normalized. 5. Neutropenia: Fever or other evidence of infection must be assessed promptly and treated aggressively. 6. Rare Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions: (similar to Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) have been anecdotally reported with riTUXimab. If such a reaction occurs, riTUXimab should be discontinued. 7. Gastrointestinal Obstruction or Perforation: There have been rare reports of gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation, sometimes fatal, when riTUXimab is given in combination with other chemotherapy, occurring 1 to 12 weeks after treatment. Symptoms possibly indicative of such complications should be carefully investigated and appropriately treated. 8. Hepatitis B Reactivation: All lymphoma patients should be tested for both HBsAg and HBcoreAb. If either test is positive, such patients should be treated with LamiVUDine during chemotherapy and for six months afterwards. Such patients should also be monitored with frequent liver function tests and hepatitis B virus DNA at least every two months. If the hepatitis B virus DNA level rises during this monitoring, management should be reviewed with an appropriate specialist with experience managing hepatitis and consideration given to halting chemotherapy. 9. Possible interactions with proton pump inhibitors (e.g., pantoprazole, omeprazole, lansoprazole) have been reported, resulting in elevated methotrexate levels and increased risk of methotrexate toxicity. Consider discontinuing proton pump inhibitors 1 day prior to methotrexate administration. If their use is required, closely monitor methotrexate levels and monitor for signs of methotrexate toxicity. 10. Possible interaction with penicillins (e.g., amoxicillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin). Penicillins compete with methotrexate for excretion sites in the renal tubules resulting in increased serum methotrexate and toxicity. Primarily a concern with high-dose methotrexate and thus the combination should be avoided if possible. 11. Medication Safety: riTUXimab is formulated differently for IV versus subcutaneous administration. Use caution during prescribing, product selection, preparation and administration. IV formulation is supplied as 10 mg/mL solution which must be diluted prior to administration. Subcutaneous formulation is supplied as a fixed dose of 1400 mg/11.7 mL ready-to-use solution which contains hyaluronidase to facilitate injection. 12. Increased drug absorption by hyaluronidase: other subcutaneous medications should not be injected at the same site as subcutaneous riTUXimab. Increased systemic effects are unlikely to be clinically significant with topical applications of EMLA, hydrocortisone, or diphenhydrAMINE.\\t', '\\tCall Dr. Diego Villa or tumour group delegate at (604) 877-6000 or 1-800-663-3333 with any problems or questions regarding this treatment program.\\t', \"\\t1.

Renal Dysfunction: • If GFR (or CrCl) less than 60 mL/min, reversible causes of renal dysfunction should be treated and the patient reassessed for suitability for this treatment once renal function improves. • Use the same renal function measure throughout the treatment course, i.e., if estimated GFR was used initially, subsequent dosing should be based on GFR and not CrCl\\t', '\\t2.

Third space fluids: Patients with clinically or radiologically detectable third space fluid (e.g. pleural effusion, ascites, full extremity pitting edema) should NOT be given high dose methotrexate. 2. Renal elimination: Patients with elevated serum creatinine or calculated GFR (or CrCl) below 60 mL/min should NOT receive high dose methotrexate. Avoid concomitant use of drugs that may inhibit renal elimination of methotrexate such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), salicylates and sulfa drugs. 3. Hepatitis B Reactivation: All lymphoma patients should be tested for both HBsAg and HBcoreAb. If either test is positive, such patients should be treated with lamiVUDine during chemotherapy and for six months afterwards. Such patients should also be monitored with frequent liver function tests and hepatitis B virus DNA at least every two months. If the hepatitis B virus DNA level rises during this monitoring, management should be reviewed with an appropriate specialist with experience managing hepatitis and consideration given to halting chemotherapy. 4. Cotrimoxazole Drug Interaction: Cotrimoxazole (SEPTRA®, BACTRIM®, etc) may affect methotrexate toxicity, clearance or accurate measurement in assays of concentration. See instructions under Pre-medications above for dosing guidance. 5. Possible interactions with proton pump inhibitors (e.g. pantoprazole, omeprazole, lansoprazole) have been reported, resulting in elevated methotrexate levels and increased risk of methotrexate toxicity.

The tissue that is removed should be thoroughly examined by an expert pathologist. Sometimes a very early cancer is found, but this is not common.\\t', '\\tSome general information about risk-reducing surgery is provided below. Ask your genetic counsellor or your doctor for more details if you are interested. You may also wish to speak to women who have had surgery to learn what it was like for them.\\t', '\\tSome women choose to have surgery and some do not. Having surgery to reduce cancer risk is a very personal decision. It is important to take the time you need to make the decision that is right for you. You may want to discuss this topic with your doctor. You may also want to meet with a specialist who is an expert in this area.\\t', '\\tProphylactic salpingo-oophorectomy Surgery to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes is recommended to women with a BRCA gene mutation because of the lack of good ovarian cancer screening tests. Research has found that this surgery reduces the chance of cancer in the ovaries and fallopian tubes by 80-85%. Having this surgery before menopause also appears to reduce breast cancer risk by up to 50%.\\t', '\\tWomen are strongly advised to consider having this surgery at age 35-40 or after childbearing is complete. It is important to know that the surgery will cause menopause to begin for a woman who is still having menstrual periods.\\t', '\\tProphylactic mastectomy Some women may think about having surgery to remove their healthy breasts to try to avoid ever having breast cancer. Research has found that having this surgery reduces the chance of breast cancer by about 90-95%.\\t', '\\tMost women who choose this option also plan to have breast reconstruction. It is important to think about how this surgery might change how you feel about your body, how much you worry about cancer, and many other issues.\\t', '\\tWhat about using medications to reduce cancer risks?\\t', '\\tFor pre- or post-menopausal women with an increased risk of developing breast cancer due to a family history of breast cancer, their chance of developing breast cancer can be reduced by taking a tamoxifen tablet daily for 5 years. For post-menopausal women a similar benefit has also been seen with raloxifene and exemestane tablets. Before choosing to try tamoxifen, raloxifene or exemestane you should have a detailed discussion with your doctor about the potential benefits and side-effects for you specifically, and the availability and cost of these medications.\\t', '\\tTamoxifen and raloxifene are members of a drug class called Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs). They work by interfering with the effect of the female hormone, estrogen, on the breast. Tamoxifen has been used to treat breast cancer for many years and now it is also used in women at increased risk of breast cancer to decrease their chances of developing the disease.\\t', '\\tOne American and three European research studies have examined the effectiveness of tamoxifen for the prevention of breast cancer. These studies included over 25,000 women, about half of whom received tamoxifen and half of whom received an inactive tablet (placebo).\\t', '\\tunderstanding hereditary breast & ovarian cancer – the brca genes\\t', '\\t19\\t', '\\tunderstanding hereditary breast & ovarian cancer – the brca genes\\t', '\\t18\\t', '\\tTaking care of your health\\t', '\\tListen to your body. Knowing your own body is important for any woman or man with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Recognizing symptoms and getting regular checkups may help to detect cancer early.\\t', '\\tBe aware of your body and know what is normal for you. If you notice any unusual changes, tell your doctor about them. The sooner you report signs to your doctor, the sooner a problem can be dealt with.\\t', '\\tBreast health starts with knowing your breasts, no matter what your age. Be aware of what is normal for your breasts, even if you are having regular screening tests. Some women and men find their own breast cancer through changes in the look and feel of their breasts. Many people find breast changes that turn out not to be cancer.\\t', '\\tWomen should also be aware of possible signs of ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer may not cause any symptoms in its early stages. When symptoms do start, they are often vague and easily mistaken for more common illnesses.\\t', '\\tOvarian cancer may cause:\\t', '\\t•\\t\\t\\t\\tswelling\\tor\\tbloating\\tof\\tthe abdomen\\t', '\\t•\\t\\t\\t\\tpelvic\\tdiscomfort\\tor\\theaviness\\t', '\\t•\\t\\t\\t\\tpain\\tin\\tthe\\tback\\tor\\tabdomen\\t', '\\t•\\t\\t\\t\\tfatigue\\t', '\\t•\\t\\t\\t\\tgas,\\tnausea,\\tindigestion\\t', '\\t•\\t\\t\\t\\tfeeling\\tfull\\tafter\\ta\\tlight\\tmeal\\t', '\\t•\\t\\t\\t\\tchange\\tin\\tbowel\\thabits\\t', '\\t•\\t\\t\\t\\temptying\\tyour\\tbladder frequently\\t', '\\t•\\t\\t\\t\\tirregular\\tmenstrual\\tbleeding\\t', '\\t•\\t\\t\\t\\tweight\\tloss\\tor\\tweight\\tgain\\t', '\\t•\\t\\t\\t\\tpain\\twith\\tintercourse\\t', '\\tContact your doctor if you have 1 or more of these symptoms without another obvious cause, and they are getting worse, or last longer than 2 to 3 weeks. Often such symptoms are caused by other less serious health problems, not cancer. Your doctor can arrange the tests that are needed for a diagnosis.\\t', '\\tThe consistent evidence from all of these studies is that tamoxifen, taken daily for 5 years, prevents about 4 out of 10 breast cancers. The preventive effect of tamoxifen lasts for at least 10 years (i.e. for the 5 years while the tablet is taken and for at least 5 years after). You should ask your doctor or genetic counsellor to estimate your personal breast cancer risk and to explain how much your personal risk can be reduced by taking tamoxifen for 5 years. Tamoxifen has been shown to prevent hormonally responsive (that is, estrogen receptor positive) breast cancer but did not appear to prevent the development of estrogen receptor negative cancers.\\t', '\\tUnfortunately very few women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations participated in these large trials. Therefore, these trials did not provide useful information about whether tamoxifen is effective for these specific women. However, some other studies have suggested that tamoxifen may reduce breast cancer risk by a similar amount for women who carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, but this has not been tested in clinical trials. If you have a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 you should discuss this further with your doctor.\\t', '\\tMost women who take tamoxifen tolerate it well but some experience side-effects. In the trials described above about 1 in 10 women stopped tamoxifen due to side-effects. If side effects do occur they should be discussed with your doctor who will suggest ways in which they may be improved. Alternatively your doctor may suggest stopping the medication and reviewing your options for managing your breast cancer risk. Your doctor can provide you with a list of the most common or important side-effects.\\t', '\\tunderstanding hereditary breast & ovarian cancer – the brca genes\\t', '\\t21\\t', '\\tunderstanding hereditary breast & ovarian cancer – the brca genes\\t', '\\t20\\t', '\\tIssues to consider\\t', '\\tThere are many important issues related to BRCA genetic testing. This section includes some questions that other people have asked while deciding whether or not to have genetic testing. You may wish to discuss these topics with your genetic counsellor.\\t', '\\tWhat kind of information will genetic testing give me? Genetic testing may help to clarify your risks for a new cancer diagnosis. The results cannot tell you if or when cancer will develop, or what type of cancer. Some people with a BRCA gene mutation never develop cancer, and some have several different cancers. Your genetic counsellor will discuss cancer screening based on the results of your genetic testing.\\t', '\\tWhen is the right time to have genetic testing? Deciding to have genetic testing is a choice that only you can make. It must be the right decision for you, at the right time in your life. Think about how and when you would use the test results. Some people find this an easy choice, and others find that it is very hard to decide. Talking with a genetic counsellor, your doctor, and family members may help you to make a decision. Support from those who are close to you may be helpful before and after you receive genetic test results.\\t', '\\tYou may feel pressured to have genetic testing when: - You feel it is your responsibility. Other family members may not be able to have genetic testing if you do not have the test first. - Other members in the family have a gene mutation. - Your spouse or other family members worry for you. It can be extra hard to make a decision when you feel pressure like this. You can take as much time as you need to decide, and you may want to talk with your genetic counsellor.\\t', '\\tHow might my genetic test result impact my family? It is important to remember that we share our genes with our family members. Your genetic test result may provide information about your relatives’ chance to also have a BRCA mutation. It may also impact their cancer screening advice and their cancer risks.\\t', '\\tFamily members may have very different feelings about genetic testing and cancer. It may be important to discuss your thoughts about genetic testing with key family members before your blood is tested. These are hard topics to discuss in some families. It may be stressful if family members do not agree with your decision about genetic testing. Sharing the results of genetic testing may also cause stress in families.\\t', '\\tWhat type of emotions might I feel? Talking about your family history of cancer may bring up memories from many years ago. Thinking about genetic testing and getting your test results may lead to feelings of relief, anxiety, hope, confusion, guilt or worry. Sometimes these feelings are unexpected. It may not be possible to guess how a person is going to react to their genetic test result.\\t', '\\tYou may wish to discuss your feelings with people who have given you support in other difficult situations (e.g. therapist, religious leader, support group). Referral to the BC Cancer Agency’s Patient and Family Counselling department is another option for support to address some of these feelings.\\t', '\\tIs BRCA testing offered to children? No. BRCA genetic testing is offered to people aged 18 or older. This is because a BRCA test result will not change the medical care for children. Also, it is important that a person is able to decide about genetic testing for him/herself.\\t', '\\tAre genetic test results kept confidential? Yes. Your BRCA test results are only shared with other people on your request.\\t', '\\tWill genetic testing affect my insurance? In Canada, you will have the same public health insurance whatever the result of your genetic testing. If you know you have a gene mutation, you must disclose your result to private life and medical insurance companies if you are asked. It is possible that this information could impact your chances and/or the costs of getting new life insurance or extended health coverage. You may wish to review your insurance policies before you have any genetic testing done.\\t', '\\tunderstanding hereditary breast & ovarian cancer – the brca genes\\t', '\\t23\\t', '\\tunderstanding hereditary breast & ovarian cancer – the brca genes\\t', '\\t22\\t', '\\tWhat are some pros & cons of genetic testing?\\t', '\\tThe following table lists some of the possible advantages (pros) and disadvantages (cons) of genetic testing.

DNA is packaged into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains 23 pairs, or a total of 46 chromosomes. The 23rd pair of chromosomes determines our sex – females have 2 “X” chromosomes, and males have 1 “X” and 1 “Y” chromosome.\\t', '\\tChromosomes come in pairs because one set of 23 chromosomes comes from the mother in the egg and the other set comes from the father in the sperm. When a sperm and an egg unite, they form a new cell with 46 chromosomes. When this cell (the fertilized egg) divides, all 46 chromosomes are copied and passed on to every cell that eventually makes up a new human being.\\t', '\\tLooking at a single chromosome, we see that its DNA is arranged in units called genes. Genes direct the growth, development and function of the human body; everything from eye colour, to height, to how often cells divide. We have approximately 25,000 different genes, each in a specific place on a specific chromosome. Since we have two copies of every chromosome, we also have two copies of every gene; one copy from each parent.\\t', '\\tSometimes a gene is changed in some way, so that it does not function properly.

This section includes some questions that other people have asked while deciding whether to have genetic testing. You may wish to discuss these topics with your genetic counsellor.\\t', '\\tWhat kind of information will I gain from genetic testing? Genetic testing may help to clarify your risks for a new cancer diagnosis. The results cannot tell you if, when, or what type of cancer may develop. Some people with Lynch syndrome never develop cancer, and some have several different cancers. Your genetic counsellor will discuss cancer screening based on the results of your genetic testing.\\t', '\\tWhen is the right time to have genetic testing?

You can take as much time as you need to decide, and you may want to talk with your genetic counsellor.\\t', '\\tHow might my genetic test result impact my family? It is important to remember that we share our genes with our family members. Your genetic test result may provide information about your relatives’ chance to also have Lynch syndrome. It may also impact their cancer risks and cancer screening advice.\\t', '\\tSome people choose to have prophylactic surgery and some do not. Women who have Lynch syndrome are advised to to seriously consider removing\\ttheir\\tuterus\\t(hysterectomy)\\tand\\tfallopian\\ttubes\\tafter\\tage\\t35-40 or after childbearing is complete. Women may also consider removing their ovaries either at the same time as the hysterectomy or at a later date closer to the age of natural menopause. It is important to know that removing the ovaries will cause menopause to begin for a woman who is still having periods. Removing the uterus will not cause menopause but menstrual periods will stop.\\t', '\\tColectomy, instead of segmental resection at the time of a colorectal cancer diagnosis, may be a choice for some people with Lynch syndrome. This option may be considered because the chance to develop another colorectal cancer is higher for people with Lynch syndrome than for other people with colorectal cancer.\\t', '\\tHaving surgery to reduce cancer risk is a very personal decision. Ask your genetic counsellor or your doctor for more details if you are interested. You may also want to meet with a specialist who is an expert in this area or talk to people who have had surgery to learn what it was like for them. It is important to take the time you need to make the decision that is right for you.\\t', '\\tWhat about using medications to reduce cancer risks?\\t', '\\tThere is some early evidence suggesting that the regular use of aspirin may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer and other cancers associated with Lynch Syndrome. However, the exact dose, how long it should be used for, and when to start is not yet clear. Aspirin is a widely used medication to treat minor aches and pains and to prevent heart disease and strokes, and is well tolerated by most people who use it. However, it can cause side effects in some people so it is important to discuss the current level of evidence for its cancer prevention effect with your doctor, in the setting of your own medical history, to decide whether or not it would be reasonable for you to use aspirin as a cancer prevention strategy.\\t', '\\tunderstanding lynch syndrome\\t', '\\t19\\t', '\\tunderstanding lynch syndrome\\t', '\\t18\\t', '\\tFamily members may have very different feelings about genetic testing and cancer. It may be important to discuss your thoughts about genetic testing with key family members before your blood is tested. These are hard topics to discuss in some families. It may be stressful if family members do not agree with your decision about genetic testing. Sharing the results of genetic testing may also cause stress in families.\\t', '\\tWhat type of emotions might I feel? Talking\\tabout\\tyour\\tfamily\\thistory\\tof\\tcancer\\tmay\\tbring\\tup\\tmemories from many years ago. Thinking about genetic testing and getting your test results may lead to feelings of relief, anxiety, hope, confusion, guilt or worry. Sometimes these feelings are unexpected. It may not be possible to guess how a person is going to react to their genetic test result. You may wish to discuss your feelings with people who have given you support in other difficult situations (e.g. family, friends, therapist, religious leader, support group). Referral to the BC Cancer Agency’s Patient and Family Counselling department is another option for support to address some of these feelings.\\t', '\\tIs Lynch syndrome testing offered to children? Lynch syndrome genetic testing is usually offered to people aged 18 or older. This is because a Lynch syndrome test result will not change the medical care for children. Also, it is important that a person is able to decide about genetic testing for him/herself.\\t', '\\tAre genetic test results kept confidential? Yes. Your Lynch syndrome test results are only shared with other people at your request.\\t', '\\tWill genetic testing affect my insurance? In Canada, you will have the same public health insurance whatever the result of your genetic testing. If you know you have a gene mutation, you must disclose your result to private life and medical insurance companies if you are asked. It is possible that this information could impact your chances and/or the costs of getting new life insurance or extended health coverage. You may wish to review your insurance policies before you have any genetic testing done.\\t', '\\tWhat are some pros and cons of genetic testing?\\t', '\\tThe following table lists some of the possible advantages (pros) and disadvantages (cons) of genetic testing.

It may also impact their cancer risks and cancer screening advice.\\t', '\\tSome people choose to have prophylactic surgery and some do not. Women who have Lynch syndrome are advised to to seriously consider removing\\ttheir\\tuterus\\t(hysterectomy)\\tand\\tfallopian\\ttubes\\tafter\\tage\\t35-40 or after childbearing is complete. Women may also consider removing their ovaries either at the same time as the hysterectomy or at a later date closer to the age of natural menopause. It is important to know that removing the ovaries will cause menopause to begin for a woman who is still having periods. Removing the uterus will not cause menopause but menstrual periods will stop.\\t', '\\tColectomy, instead of segmental resection at the time of a colorectal cancer diagnosis, may be a choice for some people with Lynch syndrome. This option may be considered because the chance to develop another colorectal cancer is higher for people with Lynch syndrome than for other people with colorectal cancer.\\t', '\\tHaving surgery to reduce cancer risk is a very personal decision. Ask your genetic counsellor or your doctor for more details if you are interested. You may also want to meet with a specialist who is an expert in this area or talk to people who have had surgery to learn what it was like for them. It is important to take the time you need to make the decision that is right for you.\\t', '\\tWhat about using medications to reduce cancer risks?\\t', '\\tThere is some early evidence suggesting that the regular use of aspirin may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer and other cancers associated with Lynch Syndrome. However, the exact dose, how long it should be used for, and when to start is not yet clear. Aspirin is a widely used medication to treat minor aches and pains and to prevent heart disease and strokes, and is well tolerated by most people who use it. However, it can cause side effects in some people so it is important to discuss the current level of evidence for its cancer prevention effect with your doctor, in the setting of your own medical history, to decide whether or not it would be reasonable for you to use aspirin as a cancer prevention strategy.\\t', '\\tunderstanding lynch syndrome\\t', '\\t19\\t', '\\tunderstanding lynch syndrome\\t', '\\t18\\t', '\\tFamily members may have very different feelings about genetic testing and cancer. It may be important to discuss your thoughts about genetic testing with key family members before your blood is tested. These are hard topics to discuss in some families. It may be stressful if family members do not agree with your decision about genetic testing. Sharing the results of genetic testing may also cause stress in families.\\t', '\\tWhat type of emotions might I feel? Talking\\tabout\\tyour\\tfamily\\thistory\\tof\\tcancer\\tmay\\tbring\\tup\\tmemories from many years ago. Thinking about genetic testing and getting your test results may lead to feelings of relief, anxiety, hope, confusion, guilt or worry. Sometimes these feelings are unexpected. It may not be possible to guess how a person is going to react to their genetic test result. You may wish to discuss your feelings with people who have given you support in other difficult situations (e.g. family, friends, therapist, religious leader, support group). Referral to the BC Cancer Agency’s Patient and Family Counselling department is another option for support to address some of these feelings.\\t', '\\tIs Lynch syndrome testing offered to children? Lynch syndrome genetic testing is usually offered to people aged 18 or older. This is because a Lynch syndrome test result will not change the medical care for children. Also, it is important that a person is able to decide about genetic testing for him/herself.\\t', '\\tAre genetic test results kept confidential? Yes. Your Lynch syndrome test results are only shared with other people at your request.\\t', '\\tWill genetic testing affect my insurance? In Canada, you will have the same public health insurance whatever the result of your genetic testing. If you know you have a gene mutation, you must disclose your result to private life and medical insurance companies if you are asked. It is possible that this information could impact your chances and/or the costs of getting new life insurance or extended health coverage. You may wish to review your insurance policies before you have any genetic testing done.\\t', '\\tWhat are some pros and cons of genetic testing?\\t', '\\tThe following table lists some of the possible advantages (pros) and disadvantages (cons) of genetic testing. You may find other advantages or disadvantages, which you can add to the table. This list may help you to think about which issues are most important to you.\\t', '\\tPROS CONS\\t', '\\t• Results may help some people to make medical and lifestyle decisions\\t', '\\t• There are no proven ways for mutation carriers to eliminate all risk of cancer\\t', '\\t• May provide helpful information for family members\\t', '\\t• Family members may have different ideas about sharing genetic test results\\t', '\\t• Results may help some people make decisions about risk- reducing surgery\\t', '\\t• Employers and insurance companies may treat you differently if they learn you are a gene mutation carrier\\t', '\\t• Results may reduce anxiety for some people\\t', '\\t• Results may increase anxiety for some people\\t', '\\t• May help to explain why people in the family have had cancer\\t', '\\t• A negative result may provide a false sense of security for some people\\t', '\\t• May have an impact on family relationships\\t', '\\t• May have an impact on family relationships\\t', '\\t• May be able to be involved in research studies\\t', '\\t• More research is needed to understand the long-term impact of genetic testing\\t', '\\tOther issues:\\t', '\\tunderstanding lynch syndrome\\t', '\\t21\\t', '\\tunderstanding lynch syndrome\\t', '\\t20\\t', '\\tHow do I contact the Hereditary Cancer Program?\\t', '\\tYou may contact your genetic counsellor directly at the number provided at your appointment.

A Guideline for Oxygen Therapy for Patients who have Received Bleomycin Systemic Therapy.\\t', '\\tEffective date: 27 July 2000 Prepared by: Dr. Judy Sutherland on behalf of GU Tumour Group Approved by: Provincial Systemic Program Committee\\t', '\\tThe objective of this guideline is to provide recommendations for oxygen therapy based on the quality of available published evidence relating bleomycin pulmonary toxicity (BPT) to supplemental oxygen therapy. The diagnosis and treatment of BPT have been reviewed elsewhere and will not be reported in this guideline. A MEDLINE literature search of all published abstracts, case reviews and clinical trials using the search terms \"Bleomycin\" (adverse effects, poisoning, toxicity) and \"Lung diseases\" (chemically induced) was undertaken. Documents retrieved were limited to those published in English and related to human exposure. Seventy-three publications since 1970 were identified and reviewed. The strength of the data were graded according to standard criteria.\\t', '\\t1\\t', '\\tBleomycin has been used in combination chemotherapy for patients with germ cell tumours, Hodgkin’s disease and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma for more than 20 years. Overall response rates of 50-90% have been achieved. Reported toxicities have included mucositis, hypersensitivity reactions, skin rashes and BPT. 2-4 The reported incidence of non fatal BPT is dependent on the diagnostic criteria used but appears to be 5-10% and fatal BPT has been reported in approximately 2% of treated cases. 5,6 Pulmonary toxicity may occur in the form of acute pneumonitis, chronic pulmonary fibrosis or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which is most commonly seen in the postoperative setting. 7,8 Risk factors that have been associated with BPT include age >40 years, cumulative dose of >450 units, renal failure, concomitant administration of cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and doxorubicin, chest irradiation, and positive fluid balance during prolonged surgical procedures. 5,6 Animal studies have demonstrated that supplemental oxygen may be an additional risk factor for lung toxicity\\t', '\\t9\\t', '\\t, but human data based on case reports, and retrospective reviews are less clear. Multivariate analyses in two large retrospective reviews have not identified high flow oxygen as an additional risk factor for BPT. 10,11 Prospective randomized studies evaluating pulmonary morbidity in bleomycin treated patients have not been reported.\\t', '\\tThe vast majority of the data relating BPT to oxygen therapy has been obtained from patients undergoing general anesthesia and surgical resections following chemotherapy with multiagent regimens containing bleomycin. Very little published data are available reporting the safety of chronic or short-term supplemental oxygen in non-surgical patients who have received bleomycin. In 1978, Goldiner et al. published the first report of postanesthetic complications in patients who received bleomycin for germ cell tumours and later underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection or resection of pulmonary metastases. 7 Five patients died of rapidly progressive respiratory failure. In a subsequent prospective study of 12 similar patients, the mean FIO2 was reduced to 0.24 from 0.39 and the crystalloid administration was significantly reduced from 5.86 mg/kg/h to 3.87. These patients experienced no postoperative pulmonary complications. Goldiner et al. concluded that the FIO2 during and after surgery should be kept as low as possible and that fluid status should be closely monitored to avoid excessive crystalloid administration. 7 These recommendations for anesthetic management remain the guidelines used by most anesthesiologists today. 12 Several similar case studies have been reported. 8,13 Other investigators attribute the absence of postoperative complications to the administration of a low FIO2 and limited fluids.\\t', '\\t14\\t', '\\tContrary to these recommendations, several more recent publications, which have reviewed over 300 patients undergoing general anesthesia following bleomycin containing regimens for germ cell tumors, have indicated no excess in pulmonary toxicity related to intraoperative or postoperative oxygen therapy. 10,11,15 There has been no substantial change in the anesthetic guidelines for these patients, despite the data obtained from these more recent studies. Several of these investigators have stressed that safe anesthesia for these patients may demand high flow oxygen to avoid risk of intraoperative hypoxia, particularly when one lung anesthesia and ventilation is required for lobectomy.\\t', '\\t12,16\\t', '\\tPublished data regarding the safety of exposure to high flow oxygen during recreational activities such as scuba diving are limited and patients should be counselled that safety cannot be assured during these activities.\\t', '\\tBleomycin\\t', '\\tBC Cancer Agency Cancer Drug Manual\\t', '\\t©\\t', '\\tPage 10 of 10 Bleomycin Developed: September 1994 Revised: 1 May 2007 Limited Revision: 1 March 2009, 1 June 2013, 1 December 2014\\t', '\\tImplementation of this guideline may reduce treatment-related morbidity and mortality. The magnitude of the benefit is expected to be modest given the overall low rate of BPT in current clinical practice. The success of this guideline should be evaluated by careful reporting of treatment-related toxicity in all at risk patients as it is unlikely that prospective clinical trials will be done.\\t', '\\tRECOMMENDATIONS 1. The conflicting evidence suggests that caution regarding oxygen therapy be continued, but that patients should not be denied oxygen therapy if hypoxia is documented or anticipated. 2. If supplemental oxygen is required, the lowest FIO2 that maintains adequate tissue oxygenation (as measured by arterial blood gasses or pulse oximetry) should be provided. 3. Preoperative anesthesia consultation should be mandatory for patients with a history of bleomycin therapy. 4. Recreational use of high flow oxygen (e.g., scuba diving) should be discouraged. 5. Patients should be encouraged to carry wallet cards or wrist bracelets alerting caregivers to possible toxicity associated with oxygen therapy.\\t', \"\\t1. Guyatt GH, Sackett DL, Sinclair JC, et al.

During the recovery period sustained methotrexate levels may result in substantial bone marrow and gastrointestinal toxicity. 19 Management should include continued monitoring of methotrexate levels, administration of leucovorin (see leucovorin rescue) and alkalinized intravenous fluids until plasma levels fall below 0.05 micromol/L.\\t', '\\t19\\t', '\\tGlucarpidase (carboxypeptidase-G2, CPDG2, VORAXAZE®\\t', '\\t27,28\\t', '\\t) is a recombinant bacterial enzyme that inactivates extracellular methotrexate to 2,4-diamino-N 10 –methylpteroic acid [DAMPA]. 27 Glucarpidase can rapidly lower serum methotrexate levels by >95% within 15 minutes of administration. 29 Cellular uptake of glucarpidase is increased when it is given with leucovorin.

The efficacy of tamoxifen may vary between individuals due to heterogeneous genetic variation in CYP2D6 activity, and by co-administration of a number of drugs that may modulate the activity of the enzyme.\\t', \"\\tSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI's) are a commonly used class of anti depressants which inhibit CYP2D6 to varying degrees. Concurrent administration of some SSRIs and tamoxifen has been shown to lower levels of endoxifen, but not of 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen. The clinical implications of this decline in endoxifen levels are unclear because tamoxifen concentrations do not appear to change substantially. However, retrospective evidence presented at ASCO 2009 reported that concomitant use of tamoxifen and moderate/potent CYP2D6 inhibitors significantly increased the risk of breast cancer recurrence. In the SSRI subanalysis, moderate or potent, CYP2D6 inhibitors were associated with 25-92% greater relative risk of breast cancer recurrence, depending on duration of co-exposure, compared with taking no SSRIs with tamoxifen. Weak CYP2D6 inhibitors were not associated with an increased breast cancer recurrence in this study. A recent retrospective study from Ontario also suggests that the greater risk of breast cancer recurrence with paroxetine may be associated with increased cancer death.\\t\", '\\tDrugs that could potentially cause reduction in efficacy and thus should be used with caution include any strong CYP2D6 inhibitors such as: fluoxetine, paroxetine, chlorpromazine, miconazole, quinidine, and bupropion. Moderate inhibitors include: ketoconazole, trazodone and amiodarone. The safest course of action is to avoid co- administration of tamoxifen and any of these medications. However, each individual’s particular need and circumstances should be evaluated to determine what is best for them.\\t', \"\\tSerotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRI's) like venlaflaxine and desvenlafaxine are weak CYP2D6 inhibitors and do not lower the concentration of endoxifen. These are better choices for women taking tamoxifen who also require medication for depression or relief of hot flashes.\\t\", '\\tThe following table lists examples of commonly used antidepressants and their association with CYP2D6 and tamoxifen.
