2. Milestone Presentation (10 points)Â¶
Communication skills are super important for data scientists. Please use this opportunity to practice your communication skills.

You can think of this presentation as a mid-term report of your project. Your presentation should consist of three parts:

Motivation (2). Why is it an important project? Why is it challenging?
Progress Report (2). What have you done so far? Is it on schedule?
Future work (2). What do you plan to do next? What is the detailed schedule of the remaining part of the project?
Imagine your manager (who knows little about the technical part of data science) is sitting in the audience, you need to explain your complex project to your manager in a simple way, and make her/him feel excited about it.

Did you convey complex information in a simple way? (2)
Did you excite and motivate the audience? (2)
Requirements

Search "how to give a good talk" in Google. You will find a lot of good advice. Use them to improve your presentation.

You have to do a couple of practice talks in front of your team members before the presentation day.

EVERYONE should get prepared for the presentation. In class, we will randomly pick up a student from each team and ask him/her to give a talk.

The length of a talk should be 4 mins! Pay attention to the time. If you ended up spending x mins, your team grade would be deducted by |x-4| points (rounding).
