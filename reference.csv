"	Vitamin and Mineral Supplements: If you can’t meet the recommended amounts with food alone, consider a supplement. Calcium carbonate is the least expensive calcium supplement and is well tolerated by most people when taken with food. The absorption of calcium from supplements is most efficient at doses of 500 mg or less. Some calcium supplements also include vitamin D (check the label for the exact amount). A standard multivitamin and mineral supplement provides approximately 175 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D and other nutrients.	"
"	Protein: Adequate protein is required to maintain bone health. Include one of the following protein rich foods at each meal: meat, fish, poultry, beans, lentils, nuts, eggs, milk, yogurt and cheese.	"
"	Caffeine and salt: Excess caffeine and salt can have a negative effect on bone. Caffeine is found in coffee and also tea, chocolate (cocoa) and some soft drinks. For optimal bone health limit coffee to less than 4 cups per day.	"
"	Foods high in salt generally include processed foods such as canned soups, snack foods, crackers, packaged pastas and sauces. Check the nutrition label on processed foods and limit salt to less than 2300 mg per day.	"
"	Physical Activity: Being physically active maintains optimal bone health and decreases the risk of a bone fracture by improving bone mass and increasing muscular strength, coordination and balance and thereby reducing falls. Physical activity that is weight bearing is best, examples include walking, dancing, stair climbing, aerobics, skating and weight lifting.	"
"	Smoking: Smoking is related to poor bone and general health. If you smoke, ask your doctor for assistance to stop smoking.	"

"	Refer to BCCA Hypersensitivity Guidelines for appropriate premedications in subsequent cycles.	"
"	NB: If a patient experiences a hypersensitivity reaction to PACLitaxel or CARBOplatin given intravenously, then that same drug should NOT be given intraperitonealy in that cycle or subsequent cycles. Any rechallenge considered for future treatments should be for the intravenous route only; intraperitoneal treatment with that drug should not be re-instituted.	"
"	2. Extravasation: PACLitaxel causes pain and may, rarely, cause tissue necrosis if extravasated. Refer to BCCA Extravasation Guidelines. 3. Neutropenia: Fever or other evidence of infection must be assessed promptly and treated aggressively.	"

"	PRECAUTIONS: 1. Neutropenia: Fever or other evidence of infection must be assessed promptly and treated aggressively. 2. Cardiac Toxicity: DOXOrubicin is cardiotoxic and must be used with caution, if at all, in patients with severe hypertension or cardiac dysfunction. Cardiac assessment is recommended if lifelong dose of 450 mg/m 2 to be exceeded. (BC Cancer Drug Manual) 3. Extravasation: DOXOrubicin and vinCRIStine cause pain and tissue necrosis if extravasated. Refer to BC Cancer Extravasation Guidelines. 4. Hypersensitivity: If applicable, monitor etoposide infusion for the first 15 minutes for signs of hypotension. Refer to BC Cancer Hypersensitivity Guidelines. riTUXimab can cause allergic type reactions during the IV infusion such as hypotension, wheezing, rash, flushing, alarm, pruritus, sneezing, cough, fever or faintness. For first dose, patients are to be under constant visual observation during all dose increases and for 30 minutes after infusion is completed. For all subsequent doses, constant visual observation is not required. Vital signs are not required unless symptomatic. Because transient hypotension may occur during infusion, consider withholding antihypertensive medications 12 hours prior to riTUXimab infusion. If an allergic reaction occurs, stop the infusion and the physician in charge should determine a safe time and rate to resume the infusion. A reasonable guideline is as follows. After recovery of symptoms, restart riTUXimab infusion at one infusion rate below the rate at which the reaction occurred and continue with escalation of infusion rates on the appropriate schedule above. If the infusion must be stopped a second time, restart after clearance of symptoms, at one infusion rate lower and continue at that rate without further escalation. Fatal cytokine release syndrome can occur (see below). See BC Cancer Hypersensitivity Guidelines. 5. Fatal Cytokine Release Syndrome has been reported. It usually occurs within 1-2 hours of initiating the first infusion. Initially, it is characterised by severe dyspnea (often with bronchospasm and hypoxia) in addition to fever, chills, rigors, urticaria and angioedema. Pulmonary interstitial infiltrates or edema visible on chest x-ray may accompany acute respiratory failure. There may be features of tumour lysis syndrome such as hyperuricemia, hypocalcemia, acute renal failure and elevated LDH. For severe reactions, stop the infusion immediately and evaluate for tumour lysis syndrome and pulmonary infiltration. Aggressive symptomatic treatment is required. The infusion can be resumed at no more than one-half the previous rate once all symptoms have resolved, and laboratory values and chest x-ray findings have normalized. The risk of cytokine release syndrome is low but is increased when the peripheral blood lymphocyte count is greater than 30 to 50 x 10 9 /L. While there is no requirement to withhold riTUXimab based on lymphocyte count, clinicians may wish to pre-medicate	"

"	patients with high tumour burden with steroids prior to riTUXimab infusion or omit the riTUXimab from the first cycle of treatment. 6. Rare Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions: (similar to Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) have been anecdotally reported. If such a reaction occurs, riTUXimab should be discontinued. 7. Hepatitis B Reactivation: All lymphoma patients should be tested for both HBsAg and HBcoreAb. If either test is positive, such patients should be treated with lamiVUDine during chemotherapy and for six months afterwards. Such patients should also be monitored with frequent liver function tests and hepatitis B virus DNA at least every two months. If the hepatitis B virus DNA level rises during this monitoring, management should be reviewed with an appropriate specialist with experience managing hepatitis and consideration given to halting chemotherapy. 8. Gastrointestinal Obstruction or Perforation: There have been rare reports of gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation, sometimes fatal, when riTUXimab is given in combination with other chemotherapy, occurring 1 to 12 weeks after treatment. Symptoms possibly indicative of such complications should be carefully investigated and appropriately treated. 9. Third space fluids: Patients with clinically or radiologically detectable third space fluid (e.g. pleural effusion, ascites, full extremity pitting edema) should NOT be given high dose methotrexate. 10. Renal elimination: Patients with elevated serum creatinine or calculated GFR (or CrCl) below 60 mL/min should NOT receive high dose methotrexate. Avoid concomitant use of drugs that may inhibit renal elimination of methotrexate such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), salicylates and sulfa drugs. 11. Possible interactions with proton pump inhibitors (e.g. pantoprazole, omeprazole, lansoprazole) have been reported, resulting in elevated methotrexate levels and increased risk of methotrexate toxicity. Consider discontinuing proton pump inhibitors 1 day prior to methotrexate administration. If their use if required, closely monitor methotrexate levels and monitor for signs of methotrexate toxicity. 12. Possible interaction with penicillins (e.g., amoxicillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin). Penicillins compete with methotrexate for excretion sites in the renal tubules resulting in increased serum methotrexate and toxicity. Primarily a concern with high-dose methotrexate and thus the combination should be avoided if possible. 13. Medication Safety: riTUXimab is formulated differently for IV versus subcutaneous administration. Use caution during prescribing, product selection, preparation and administration. IV formulation is supplied as 10 mg/mL solution which must be diluted prior to administration. Subcutaneous formulation is supplied as a fixed dose of 1400 mg/11.7 mL ready-to-use solution which contains hyaluronidase to facilitate injection. 14. Increased drug absorption by hyaluronidase: other subcutaneous medications should not be injected at the same site as subcutaneous riTUXimab. Increased systemic effects are unlikely to be clinically significant with topical applications of EMLA, hydrocortisone, or diphenhydrAMINE.	"

"	PRECAUTIONS: 1. Third space fluids: Patients with clinically or radiologically detectable third space fluid (e.g. pleural effusion, ascites, full extremity pitting edema) should NOT be given high dose methotrexate. 2. Renal elimination: Patients with elevated serum creatinine or calculated GFR (or CrCl) below 60 mL/min should NOT receive high dose methotrexate. Avoid concomitant use of drugs that may inhibit renal elimination of methotrexate such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), salicylates and sulfa drugs. 3. Hepatitis B Reactivation: All lymphoma patients should be tested for both HBsAg and HBcAb. If either test is positive, such patients should be treated with lamiVUDine during chemotherapy and for six months afterwards. Such patients should also be monitored with frequent liver function tests and hepatitis B virus DNA at least every two months. If the hepatitis B virus DNA level rises during this monitoring, management should be reviewed with an appropriate specialist with experience managing hepatitis and consideration given to halting chemotherapy. 4. Cotrimoxazole Drug Interaction: Cotrimoxazole (Septra ®, Bactrim®, etc) may affect methotrexate toxicity, clearance or accurate measurement in assays of concentration. See instructions under Pre- medications above for dosing guidance. 5. Possible interactions with proton pump inhibitors (e.g. pantoprazole, omeprazole, lansoprazole) have been reported, resulting in elevated methotrexate levels and increased risk of methotrexate toxicity. Consider discontinuing proton pump inhibitors 1 day prior to methotrexate administration. If their use is required, closely monitor methotrexate levels and monitor for signs of methotrexate toxicity. 6. Possible interaction with penicillins (e.g., amoxicillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin). Penicillins compete with methotrexate for excretion sites in the renal tubules resulting in increased serum methotrexate and toxicity. Primarily a concern with high-dose methotrexate and thus the combination should be avoided if possible.	"

"	2. Mucositis greater than or equal to Grade 3 (painful erythema, edema or ulcers and cannot eat), reduce methotrexate to 80% or prolong routine rescue for 2 more days (unless abnormal methotrexate levels).	"
"	PRECAUTIONS: 1. Third space fluids: Patients with clinically or radiologically detectable third space fluid (e.g. pleural effusion, ascites, full extremity pitting edema) should NOT be given high dose methotrexate. 2. Renal elimination: Patients with elevated serum creatinine or calculated GFR (or CrCl) below 60 mL/min should NOT receive high dose methotrexate. Avoid concomitant use of drugs that may inhibit renal elimination of methotrexate such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), salicylates and sulfa drugs. 3. Hepatitis B Reactivation: All lymphoma patients should be tested for both HBsAg and HBcoreAb. If either test is positive, such patients should be treated with lamiVUDine during chemotherapy and for six months afterwards. Such patients should also be monitored with frequent liver function tests and hepatitis B virus DNA at least every two months. If the hepatitis B virus DNA level rises during this monitoring, management should be reviewed with an appropriate specialist with experience managing hepatitis and consideration given to halting chemotherapy. 4. Cotrimoxazole Drug Interaction: Cotrimoxazole (SEPTRA®, BACTRIM®, etc) may affect methotrexate toxicity, clearance or accurate measurement in assays of concentration. See instructions under Pre-medications above for dosing guidance. 5. Possible interactions with proton pump inhibitors (e.g. pantoprazole, omeprazole, lansoprazole) have been reported, resulting in elevated methotrexate levels and increased risk of methotrexate toxicity. Consider discontinuing proton pump inhibitors 1 day prior to methotrexate administration. If their use if required, closely monitor methotrexate levels and monitor for signs of methotrexate toxicity. 6. Possible interaction with penicillins (e.g., amoxicillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin). Penicillins compete with methotrexate for excretion sites in the renal tubules resulting in increased serum methotrexate and toxicity. Primarily a concern with high-dose methotrexate and thus the combination should be avoided if possible.	"

"	3. Mucositis: Grade 3 or 4 (painful erythema, edema, ulcers and cannot eat), reduce methotrexate to 80% or prolong routine rescue by 2 more days (unless patient has abnormal methotrexate levels) PRECAUTIONS: 1. Neutropenia: Fever or other evidence of infection must be assessed promptly and treated aggressively. Refer to BCCA Febrile Neutropenia Guidelines. 2. Third space fluids: Patients with clinically or radiologically detectable third space fluids (e.g. pleural effusion, ascites, full extremity pitting edema) should NOT be given high dose methotrexate. 3. Renal elimination: Patients with elevated serum creatinine levels or calculated creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min should NOT receive high dose methotrexate. Avoid concomitant use of drugs that may inhibit renal elimination of methotrexate such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), salicylates, and sulfa drugs. 4. Possible interactions with proton pump inhibitors (e.g. pantoprazole, omeprazole, lansoprazole) have been reported, resulting in elevated methotrexate levels and increased risk of methotrexate toxicity. Consider discontinuing proton pump inhibitors 1 day prior to methotrexate administration. If their use is required, closely monitor methotrexate levels and monitor for signs of methotrexate toxicity.

"	What about surgery to reduce cancer risks?	"
"	Women with a BRCA gene mutation may think about 2 types of surgery to reduce their cancer risks: • salpingo-oophorectomy	is	surgery	to	remove	the	ovaries and fallopian tubes • mastectomy	is	surgery	to	remove	the	breasts	"
"	Surgery that is done to try to prevent cancer is called prophylactic or risk-reducing. The tissue that is removed should be thoroughly examined by an expert pathologist. Sometimes a very early cancer is found, but this is not common.	"
"	Some general information about risk-reducing surgery is provided below. Ask your genetic counsellor or your doctor for more details if you are interested. You may also wish to speak to women who have had surgery to learn what it was like for them.	"
"	Some women choose to have surgery and some do not. Having surgery to reduce cancer risk is a very personal decision. It is important to take the time you need to make the decision that is right for you. You may want to discuss this topic with your doctor. You may also want to meet with a specialist who is an expert in this area.	"
"	Prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy Surgery to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes is recommended to women with a BRCA gene mutation because of the lack of good ovarian cancer screening tests. Research has found that this surgery reduces the chance of cancer in the ovaries and fallopian tubes by 80-85%. Having this surgery before menopause also appears to reduce breast cancer risk by up to 50%.	"
"	Women are strongly advised to consider having this surgery at age 35-40 or after childbearing is complete. It is important to know that the surgery will cause menopause to begin for a woman who is still having menstrual periods.	"
"	Prophylactic mastectomy Some women may think about having surgery to remove their healthy breasts to try to avoid ever having breast cancer. Research has found that having this surgery reduces the chance of breast cancer by about 90-95%.	"
"	Most women who choose this option also plan to have breast reconstruction. It is important to think about how this surgery might change how you feel about your body, how much you worry about cancer, and many other issues.	"
"	What about using medications to reduce cancer risks?	"
"	For pre- or post-menopausal women with an increased risk of developing breast cancer due to a family history of breast cancer, their chance of developing breast cancer can be reduced by taking a tamoxifen tablet daily for 5 years. For post-menopausal women a similar benefit has also been seen with raloxifene and exemestane tablets. Before choosing to try tamoxifen, raloxifene or exemestane you should have a detailed discussion with your doctor about the potential benefits and side-effects for you specifically, and the availability and cost of these medications.	"
"	Tamoxifen and raloxifene are members of a drug class called Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs). They work by interfering with the effect of the female hormone, estrogen, on the breast. Tamoxifen has been used to treat breast cancer for many years and now it is also used in women at increased risk of breast cancer to decrease their chances of developing the disease.	"
"	One American and three European research studies have examined the effectiveness of tamoxifen for the prevention of breast cancer. These studies included over 25,000 women, about half of whom received tamoxifen and half of whom received an inactive tablet (placebo).	"

"	Taking care of your health	"
"	Listen to your body. Knowing your own body is important for any woman or man with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Recognizing symptoms and getting regular checkups may help to detect cancer early.	"
"	Be aware of your body and know what is normal for you. If you notice any unusual changes, tell your doctor about them. The sooner you report signs to your doctor, the sooner a problem can be dealt with.	"
"	Breast health starts with knowing your breasts, no matter what your age. Be aware of what is normal for your breasts, even if you are having regular screening tests. Some women and men find their own breast cancer through changes in the look and feel of their breasts. Many people find breast changes that turn out not to be cancer.	"
"	Women should also be aware of possible signs of ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer may not cause any symptoms in its early stages. When symptoms do start, they are often vague and easily mistaken for more common illnesses.	"
"	Ovarian cancer may cause:	"
"	•				swelling	or	bloating	of	the abdomen	"
"	•				pelvic	discomfort	or	heaviness	"
"	•				pain	in	the	back	or	abdomen	"
"	•				fatigue	"
"	•				gas,	nausea,	indigestion	"
"	•				feeling	full	after	a	light	meal	"
"	•				change	in	bowel	habits	"
"	•				emptying	your	bladder frequently	"
"	•				irregular	menstrual	bleeding	"
"	•				weight	loss	or	weight	gain	"
"	•				pain	with	intercourse	"
"	Contact your doctor if you have 1 or more of these symptoms without another obvious cause, and they are getting worse, or last longer than 2 to 3 weeks. Often such symptoms are caused by other less serious health problems, not cancer. Your doctor can arrange the tests that are needed for a diagnosis.	"
"	The consistent evidence from all of these studies is that tamoxifen, taken daily for 5 years, prevents about 4 out of 10 breast cancers. The preventive effect of tamoxifen lasts for at least 10 years (i.e. for the 5 years while the tablet is taken and for at least 5 years after). You should ask your doctor or genetic counsellor to estimate your personal breast cancer risk and to explain how much your personal risk can be reduced by taking tamoxifen for 5 years. Tamoxifen has been shown to prevent hormonally responsive (that is, estrogen receptor positive) breast cancer but did not appear to prevent the development of estrogen receptor negative cancers.	"
"	Unfortunately very few women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations participated in these large trials. Therefore, these trials did not provide useful information about whether tamoxifen is effective for these specific women. However, some other studies have suggested that tamoxifen may reduce breast cancer risk by a similar amount for women who carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, but this has not been tested in clinical trials. If you have a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 you should discuss this further with your doctor.	"
"	Most women who take tamoxifen tolerate it well but some experience side-effects. In the trials described above about 1 in 10 women stopped tamoxifen due to side-effects. If side effects do occur they should be discussed with your doctor who will suggest ways in which they may be improved. Alternatively your doctor may suggest stopping the medication and reviewing your options for managing your breast cancer risk. Your doctor can provide you with a list of the most common or important side-effects.	"

"	Issues to consider	"
"	There are many important issues related to BRCA genetic testing. This section includes some questions that other people have asked while deciding whether or not to have genetic testing. You may wish to discuss these topics with your genetic counsellor.	"
"	What kind of information will genetic testing give me? Genetic testing may help to clarify your risks for a new cancer diagnosis. The results cannot tell you if or when cancer will develop, or what type of cancer. Some people with a BRCA gene mutation never develop cancer, and some have several different cancers. Your genetic counsellor will discuss cancer screening based on the results of your genetic testing.	"
"	When is the right time to have genetic testing? Deciding to have genetic testing is a choice that only you can make. It must be the right decision for you, at the right time in your life. Think about how and when you would use the test results. Some people find this an easy choice, and others find that it is very hard to decide. Talking with a genetic counsellor, your doctor, and family members may help you to make a decision. Support from those who are close to you may be helpful before and after you receive genetic test results.	"
"	You may feel pressured to have genetic testing when: - You feel it is your responsibility. Other family members may not be able to have genetic testing if you do not have the test first. - Other members in the family have a gene mutation. - Your spouse or other family members worry for you. It can be extra hard to make a decision when you feel pressure like this. You can take as much time as you need to decide, and you may want to talk with your genetic counsellor.	"
"	How might my genetic test result impact my family? It is important to remember that we share our genes with our family members. Your genetic test result may provide information about your relatives’ chance to also have a BRCA mutation. It may also impact their cancer screening advice and their cancer risks.	"
"	Family members may have very different feelings about genetic testing and cancer. It may be important to discuss your thoughts about genetic testing with key family members before your blood is tested. These are hard topics to discuss in some families. It may be stressful if family members do not agree with your decision about genetic testing. Sharing the results of genetic testing may also cause stress in families.	"
"	What type of emotions might I feel? Talking about your family history of cancer may bring up memories from many years ago. Thinking about genetic testing and getting your test results may lead to feelings of relief, anxiety, hope, confusion, guilt or worry. Sometimes these feelings are unexpected. It may not be possible to guess how a person is going to react to their genetic test result.	"
"	You may wish to discuss your feelings with people who have given you support in other difficult situations (e.g. therapist, religious leader, support group). Referral to the BC Cancer Agency’s Patient and Family Counselling department is another option for support to address some of these feelings.	"
"	Is BRCA testing offered to children? No. BRCA genetic testing is offered to people aged 18 or older. This is because a BRCA test result will not change the medical care for children. Also, it is important that a person is able to decide about genetic testing for him/herself.	"
"	Are genetic test results kept confidential? Yes. Your BRCA test results are only shared with other people on your request.	"
"	Will genetic testing affect my insurance? In Canada, you will have the same public health insurance whatever the result of your genetic testing. If you know you have a gene mutation, you must disclose your result to private life and medical insurance companies if you are asked. It is possible that this information could impact your chances and/or the costs of getting new life insurance or extended health coverage. You may wish to review your insurance policies before you have any genetic testing done.	"

"	Appendix: What are DNA, chromosomes & genes?	"
"	Every cell in the human body contains a chemical substance called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA is packaged into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains 23 pairs, or a total of 46 chromosomes. The 23rd pair of chromosomes determines our sex – females have 2 “X” chromosomes, and males have 1 “X” and 1 “Y” chromosome.	"
"	Chromosomes come in pairs because one set of 23 chromosomes comes from the mother in the egg and the other set comes from the father in the sperm. When a sperm and an egg unite, they form a new cell with 46 chromosomes. When this cell (the fertilized egg) divides, all 46 chromosomes are copied and passed on to every cell that eventually makes up a new human being.	"
"	Looking at a single chromosome, we see that its DNA is arranged in units called genes. Genes direct the growth, development and function of the human body; everything from eye colour, to height, to how often cells divide. We have approximately 25,000 different genes, each in a specific place on a specific chromosome. Since we have two copies of every chromosome, we also have two copies of every gene; one copy from each parent.	"
"	Sometimes a gene is changed in some way, so that it does not function properly. A change in a gene is called a mutation.	"

"	The goal of cancer screening is to find a cancer as early as possible, when treatment is likely to be most effective. Screening can also prevent colon cancer by finding and removing polyps from the colon before they become a cancer.	"
"	Colorectal cancer	"
"	Screening by colonoscopy is recommended for men and women with Lynch syndrome. This should usually start at age 25, OR 5-10 years before the youngest age of colorectal cancer diagnosis in the family, whichever is earlier.	Colonoscopy	screening	should	occur	every	1-2	years	until	age	40. After	age	40,	colonoscopy	should	be	done	every	year.	"
"	It is also important to be aware of common signs of colorectal cancer and bring any new concerns to a doctor’s attention. Signs of colorectal cancer might include:	"
"	• Unexplained	change	in	bowel	habits	(constipation	or	diarrhea)	"
"	• Change	in	size/shape	of	stools	(e.g.	narrower	than	usual)	"
"	• Blood	in	or	on	the	stool	(bright	red	or	dark)	"
"	• Persistent	abdominal	pain/discomfort	(bloating,	fullness,	cramps, gas pain)	"
"	• Unexplained	weight	loss	"
"	Endometrial (uterine) cancer	"
"	For most women, abnormal vaginal bleeding is the first sign of endometrial cancer. This means that new heavy bleeding with menstrual periods, bleeding between periods, or bleeding after menopause, should be brought to a doctor’s attention. Other signs may include: watery pink or white vaginal discharge, pain in the lower abdomen or pelvic area, or pain during sexual intercourse.	"
"	Women with Lynch Syndrome should have prompt and complete investigation of any possible signs of endometrial cancer such as unusual vaginal bleeding with/between menstrual periods or occurring at any time after menopause. Although its effectiveness has not been proven, women may also consider having an internal (pelvic) exam every year or having an endometrial biopsy and transvaginal ultrasound every year, starting somewhere between age 25-35.	"
"	Other cancers	"
"	Ovarian cancer screening is not recommended at this time as current tests do not reliably detect ovarian cancer at an early stage.	"
"	If your family history includes other Lynch syndrome related cancers, additional screening may be discussed with your genetic counsellor. However, there are no standard screening guidelines at this time.	"
"	What about surgery to reduce cancer risks?	"
"	Surgery that is done to try to prevent cancer is called prophylactic or risk- reducing surgery. Some people with Lynch syndrome consider 3 types of surgery to reduce their cancer risks:	"
"	• Hysterectomy	is	surgery	to	remove	the	uterus	"
"	• Salpingo-oophorectomy	is	surgery	to	remove	the	ovaries and fallopian tubes	"
"	• Colectomy	is	surgery	to	remove	the	colon	"

"	What are some issues to consider?	"
"	There are many important issues related to Lynch syndrome genetic testing. This section includes some questions that other people have asked while deciding whether to have genetic testing. You may wish to discuss these topics with your genetic counsellor.	"
"	What kind of information will I gain from genetic testing? Genetic testing may help to clarify your risks for a new cancer diagnosis. The results cannot tell you if, when, or what type of cancer may develop. Some people with Lynch syndrome never develop cancer, and some have several different cancers. Your genetic counsellor will discuss cancer screening based on the results of your genetic testing.	"
"	When is the right time to have genetic testing? Deciding to have genetic testing is a choice that only you can make. It must be the right decision for you, at the right time in your life. Think about how and when you would use the test results. Some people find this an	easy	choice,	and	others	find	that	it	is	very	hard	to	decide.	Talking	with a genetic counsellor, your doctor, and family members may help you to make a decision. Support from those who are close to you may be helpful before and after you receive genetic test results.	"
"	You may feel pressured to have genetic testing when:	"
"	• You	feel	it	is	your	responsibility.	Other	family	members	may	not	be  able to have genetic testing if you do not have the test first • Other	members	in	the	family	have	a	gene	mutation    • Your	spouse	or	other	family	members	are	worried	about	you It may be hard to make a decision when you feel pressure like this. You can take as much time as you need to decide, and you may want to talk with your genetic counsellor.	"
"	How might my genetic test result impact my family? It is important to remember that we share our genes with our family members. Your genetic test result may provide information about your relatives’ chance to also have Lynch syndrome. It may also impact their cancer risks and cancer screening advice.	"
"	Some people choose to have prophylactic surgery and some do not. Women who have Lynch syndrome are advised to to seriously consider removing	their	uterus	(hysterectomy)	and	fallopian	tubes	after	age	35-40 or after childbearing is complete. Women may also consider removing their ovaries either at the same time as the hysterectomy or at a later date closer to the age of natural menopause. It is important to know that removing the ovaries will cause menopause to begin for a woman who is still having periods. Removing the uterus will not cause menopause but menstrual periods will stop.	"
"	Colectomy, instead of segmental resection at the time of a colorectal cancer diagnosis, may be a choice for some people with Lynch syndrome. This option may be considered because the chance to develop another colorectal cancer is higher for people with Lynch syndrome than for other people with colorectal cancer.	"
"	Having surgery to reduce cancer risk is a very personal decision. Ask your genetic counsellor or your doctor for more details if you are interested. You may also want to meet with a specialist who is an expert in this area or talk to people who have had surgery to learn what it was like for them. It is important to take the time you need to make the decision that is right for you.	"
"	What about using medications to reduce cancer risks?	"
"	There is some early evidence suggesting that the regular use of aspirin may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer and other cancers associated with Lynch Syndrome. However, the exact dose, how long it should be used for, and when to start is not yet clear. Aspirin is a widely used medication to treat minor aches and pains and to prevent heart disease and strokes, and is well tolerated by most people who use it. However, it can cause side effects in some people so it is important to discuss the current level of evidence for its cancer prevention effect with your doctor, in the setting of your own medical history, to decide whether or not it would be reasonable for you to use aspirin as a cancer prevention strategy.

"	Family members may have very different feelings about genetic testing and cancer. It may be important to discuss your thoughts about genetic testing with key family members before your blood is tested. These are hard topics to discuss in some families. It may be stressful if family members do not agree with your decision about genetic testing. Sharing the results of genetic testing may also cause stress in families.	"
"	What type of emotions might I feel? Talking	about	your	family	history	of	cancer	may	bring	up	memories from many years ago. Thinking about genetic testing and getting your test results may lead to feelings of relief, anxiety, hope, confusion, guilt or worry. Sometimes these feelings are unexpected. It may not be possible to guess how a person is going to react to their genetic test result. You may wish to discuss your feelings with people who have given you support in other difficult situations (e.g. family, friends, therapist, religious leader, support group). Referral to the BC Cancer Agency’s Patient and Family Counselling department is another option for support to address some of these feelings.	"
"	Is Lynch syndrome testing offered to children? Lynch syndrome genetic testing is usually offered to people aged 18 or older. This is because a Lynch syndrome test result will not change the medical care for children. Also, it is important that a person is able to decide about genetic testing for him/herself.	"
"	Are genetic test results kept confidential? Yes. Your Lynch syndrome test results are only shared with other people at your request.	"
"	Will genetic testing affect my insurance? In Canada, you will have the same public health insurance whatever the result of your genetic testing. If you know you have a gene mutation, you must disclose your result to private life and medical insurance companies if you are asked. It is possible that this information could impact your chances and/or the costs of getting new life insurance or extended health coverage. You may wish to review your insurance policies before you have any genetic testing done.	"
"	What are some pros and cons of genetic testing?	"
"	The following table lists some of the possible advantages (pros) and disadvantages (cons) of genetic testing. You may find other advantages or disadvantages, which you can add to the table. This list may help you to think about which issues are most important to you.	"
"	PROS CONS	"
"	• Results may help some people to make medical and lifestyle decisions	"
"	• There are no proven ways for mutation carriers to eliminate all risk of cancer	"
"	• May provide helpful information for family members	"
"	• Family members may have different ideas about sharing genetic test results	"
"	• Results may help some people make decisions about risk- reducing surgery	"
"	• Employers and insurance companies may treat you differently if they learn you are a gene mutation carrier	"
"	• Results may reduce anxiety for some people	"
"	• Results may increase anxiety for some people	"
"	• May help to explain why people in the family have had cancer	"
"	• A negative result may provide a false sense of security for some people	"
"	• May have an impact on family relationships	"
"	• May have an impact on family relationships	"
"	• May be able to be involved in research studies	"

Genes direct the growth, development and function of the human body; everything from eye colour, to height, to how often cells divide. We have approximately 25,000 different genes, each in a specific place on a specific chromosome. Since we have two copies of every chromosome, we also have two copies of every gene; one copy from each parent.	"

"	The goal of cancer screening is to find a cancer as early as possible, when treatment is likely to be most effective. Screening can also prevent colon cancer by finding and removing polyps from the colon before they become a cancer.	"
"	Colorectal cancer	"
"	Screening by colonoscopy is recommended for men and women with Lynch syndrome. This should usually start at age 25, OR 5-10 years before the youngest age of colorectal cancer diagnosis in the family, whichever is earlier.	Colonoscopy	screening	should	occur	every	1-2	years	until	age	40. After	age	40,	colonoscopy	should	be	done	every	year.	"
"	It is also important to be aware of common signs of colorectal cancer and bring any new concerns to a doctor’s attention. Signs of colorectal cancer might include:	"
"	• Unexplained	change	in	bowel	habits	(constipation	or	diarrhea)	"
"	• Change	in	size/shape	of	stools	(e.g.	narrower	than	usual)	"
"	• Blood	in	or	on	the	stool	(bright	red	or	dark)	"
"	• Persistent	abdominal	pain/discomfort	(bloating,	fullness,	cramps, gas pain)	"
"	• Unexplained	weight	loss	"
"	Endometrial (uterine) cancer	"
"	For most women, abnormal vaginal bleeding is the first sign of endometrial cancer. This means that new heavy bleeding with menstrual periods, bleeding between periods, or bleeding after menopause, should be brought to a doctor’s attention. Other signs may include: watery pink or white vaginal discharge, pain in the lower abdomen or pelvic area, or pain during sexual intercourse.	"
"	Women with Lynch Syndrome should have prompt and complete investigation of any possible signs of endometrial cancer such as unusual vaginal bleeding with/between menstrual periods or occurring at any time after menopause. Although its effectiveness has not been proven, women may also consider having an internal (pelvic) exam every year or having an endometrial biopsy and transvaginal ultrasound every year, starting somewhere between age 25-35.	"
"	Other cancers	"
"	Ovarian cancer screening is not recommended at this time as current tests do not reliably detect ovarian cancer at an early stage.	"
"	If your family history includes other Lynch syndrome related cancers, additional screening may be discussed with your genetic counsellor. However, there are no standard screening guidelines at this time.	"
"	What about surgery to reduce cancer risks?	"
"	Surgery that is done to try to prevent cancer is called prophylactic or risk- reducing surgery. Some people with Lynch syndrome consider 3 types of surgery to reduce their cancer risks:	"
"	• Hysterectomy	is	surgery	to	remove	the	uterus	"
"	• Salpingo-oophorectomy	is	surgery	to	remove	the	ovaries and fallopian tubes	"
"	• Colectomy	is	surgery	to	remove	the	colon	"
"	understanding lynch syndrome	"

"	understanding lynch syndrome	"

"	What are some issues to consider?	"
"	There are many important issues related to Lynch syndrome genetic testing. This section includes some questions that other people have asked while deciding whether to have genetic testing. You may wish to discuss these topics with your genetic counsellor.	"
"	What kind of information will I gain from genetic testing? Genetic testing may help to clarify your risks for a new cancer diagnosis. The results cannot tell you if, when, or what type of cancer may develop. Some people with Lynch syndrome never develop cancer, and some have several different cancers. Your genetic counsellor will discuss cancer screening based on the results of your genetic testing.	"
"	When is the right time to have genetic testing? Deciding to have genetic testing is a choice that only you can make. It must be the right decision for you, at the right time in your life. Think about how and when you would use the test results. Some people find this an	easy	choice,	and	others	find	that	it	is	very	hard	to	decide.	Talking	with a genetic counsellor, your doctor, and family members may help you to make a decision. Support from those who are close to you may be helpful before and after you receive genetic test results.	"
"	You may feel pressured to have genetic testing when:	"
"	• You	feel	it	is	your	responsibility.	Other	family	members	may	not	be  able to have genetic testing if you do not have the test first • Other	members	in	the	family	have	a	gene	mutation    • Your	spouse	or	other	family	members	are	worried	about	you It may be hard to make a decision when you feel pressure like this. You can take as much time as you need to decide, and you may want to talk with your genetic counsellor.	"
"	How might my genetic test result impact my family? It is important to remember that we share our genes with our family members. Your genetic test result may provide information about your relatives’ chance to also have Lynch syndrome. It may also impact their cancer risks and cancer screening advice.	"
"	Some people choose to have prophylactic surgery and some do not. Women who have Lynch syndrome are advised to to seriously consider removing	their	uterus	(hysterectomy)	and	fallopian	tubes	after	age	35-40 or after childbearing is complete. Women may also consider removing their ovaries either at the same time as the hysterectomy or at a later date closer to the age of natural menopause. It is important to know that removing the ovaries will cause menopause to begin for a woman who is still having periods. Removing the uterus will not cause menopause but menstrual periods will stop.	"
"	Colectomy, instead of segmental resection at the time of a colorectal cancer diagnosis, may be a choice for some people with Lynch syndrome. This option may be considered because the chance to develop another colorectal cancer is higher for people with Lynch syndrome than for other people with colorectal cancer.	"
"	Having surgery to reduce cancer risk is a very personal decision. Ask your genetic counsellor or your doctor for more details if you are interested. You may also want to meet with a specialist who is an expert in this area or talk to people who have had surgery to learn what it was like for them. It is important to take the time you need to make the decision that is right for you.	"
"	What about using medications to reduce cancer risks?	"
"	There is some early evidence suggesting that the regular use of aspirin may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer and other cancers associated with Lynch Syndrome. However, the exact dose, how long it should be used for, and when to start is not yet clear. Aspirin is a widely used medication to treat minor aches and pains and to prevent heart disease and strokes, and is well tolerated by most people who use it. However, it can cause side effects in some people so it is important to discuss the current level of evidence for its cancer prevention effect with your doctor, in the setting of your own medical history, to decide whether or not it would be reasonable for you to use aspirin as a cancer prevention strategy.

"	Family members may have very different feelings about genetic testing and cancer. It may be important to discuss your thoughts about genetic testing with key family members before your blood is tested. These are hard topics to discuss in some families. It may be stressful if family members do not agree with your decision about genetic testing. Sharing the results of genetic testing may also cause stress in families.	"
"	What type of emotions might I feel? Talking	about	your	family	history	of	cancer	may	bring	up	memories from many years ago. Thinking about genetic testing and getting your test results may lead to feelings of relief, anxiety, hope, confusion, guilt or worry. Sometimes these feelings are unexpected. It may not be possible to guess how a person is going to react to their genetic test result. You may wish to discuss your feelings with people who have given you support in other difficult situations (e.g. family, friends, therapist, religious leader, support group). Referral to the BC Cancer Agency’s Patient and Family Counselling department is another option for support to address some of these feelings.	"
"	Is Lynch syndrome testing offered to children? Lynch syndrome genetic testing is usually offered to people aged 18 or older. This is because a Lynch syndrome test result will not change the medical care for children. Also, it is important that a person is able to decide about genetic testing for him/herself.	"
"	Are genetic test results kept confidential? Yes. Your Lynch syndrome test results are only shared with other people at your request.	"
"	Will genetic testing affect my insurance? In Canada, you will have the same public health insurance whatever the result of your genetic testing. If you know you have a gene mutation, you must disclose your result to private life and medical insurance companies if you are asked. It is possible that this information could impact your chances and/or the costs of getting new life insurance or extended health coverage. You may wish to review your insurance policies before you have any genetic testing done.	"
"	What are some pros and cons of genetic testing?	"
"	The following table lists some of the possible advantages (pros) and disadvantages (cons) of genetic testing. You may find other advantages or disadvantages, which you can add to the table. This list may help you to think about which issues are most important to you.	"
"	PROS CONS	"
"	• Results may help some people to make medical and lifestyle decisions	"
"	• There are no proven ways for mutation carriers to eliminate all risk of cancer	"
"	• May provide helpful information for family members	"
"	• Family members may have different ideas about sharing genetic test results	"
"	• Results may help some people make decisions about risk- reducing surgery	"
"	• Employers and insurance companies may treat you differently if they learn you are a gene mutation carrier	"
"	• Results may reduce anxiety for some people	"
"	• Results may increase anxiety for some people	"
"	• May help to explain why people in the family have had cancer	"
"	• A negative result may provide a false sense of security for some people	"
"	• May have an impact on family relationships	"
"	• May have an impact on family relationships	"
"	• May be able to be involved in research studies	"
"	• More research is needed to understand the long-term impact of genetic testing	"

Word of mouth spreads quickly through workplaces, church groups and neighbourhoods. Be someone’s angel. It’s the best money you will ever spend. Director Woody Allen once said: “80% of success in life is just showing up.” There is no more important time to ‘show up’ than when someone has heard the words “You have a brain tumour.” Show up, and your presence will embody these words: “You’re not alone.”	"

"	CANCER DRUG MANUAL “INTERIM” DRUG MONOGRAPH AND PATIENT HANDOUT:	"
"	Interim monographs and patient handouts may be provided for non-benefit drugs which are available at BC Cancer through the BC Cancer Compassionate Access Program (CAP). Interim monographs may also be provided for parenteral non-benefit drugs which are not yet marketed in Canada but are accessible through the Health Canada Special Access Program (SAP) and approved for use at BC Cancer through CAP. In some cases, these drugs may be supplied by companies outside of Canada.	"
"	Interim monographs are limited in scope and will mainly provide information that is necessary to ensure safe preparation and administration of the drug at BC Cancer (e.g., dosing, preparation, administration, and toxicity). See BC Cancer Policy III-90: Parenteral Drug Therapy Policy. Some sections of the interim documents may be abbreviated or omitted as compared to the full drug monograph, particularly if prepared in an expedited fashion for a specific CAP request. Refer to the CAP approval by which a patient is being treated.	"
"	Each interim drug monograph contains the following sections:	"
"	DRUG NAME:	"
"	• Depending on the country of origin, generic name will be listed as per the approved monograph from Health Canada, US Food and Drug Administration, or European Medicines Agency as applicable or, if not yet marketed, from the available product information.	"
"	SYNONYM(S):	"
"	• Includes alternate generic names used in Canada and the US (if applicable).	"
"	COMMON TRADE NAME(S):	"

"	• Brief description of the mechanism of action to provide the rationale for drug choice and to help predict the effect and toxicity of a drug.	"
"	USES:	"
"	• Includes only malignant conditions that may be treated with this drug. • Health Canada approved indications and common off label indications may be included (if applicable).	"
"	• NOTE: Inclusion of an indication in this section does NOT imply that it is a BC Cancer approved	"
"	indication.	"
"	SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS:	"
"	• Includes special considerations for identifying patients who should NOT receive a drug or should receive it with cautions or dose adjustment. • May be abbreviated compared to the full CDM monograph and may not contain information about carcinogenicity, pregnancy, fertility, etc.	"
"	SIDE EFFECTS:	"
"	• Focus is primarily on acute reactions. • Includes adverse events that may present during drug treatment but do not necessarily have a causal relationship with the drug, as well as adverse reactions that are suspected to be related to the drug.	"
"	1,2	"
"	BC Cancer Drug Manual © User Guide Developed: 12 December 2000 Revised: 1 March 2019 Page 4/7	"
"	• Side effects are presented in table format; although some selected side effects may be described in greater detail in paragraphs after the table. • Side effects are categorized according to the US National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)	"
"	1	"
"	, with the exception of febrile neutropenia which is included in the blood/bone marrow category for ease of cross-reference between course of neutropenia and infection. • Other features of the table include:	"
"	- Extravasation hazard is classified as vesicant, irritant, or none. See BC Cancer Policy III-20 Prevention and Management of Extravasation of Chemotherapy.. - Emetogenic potential is classified according to the percentage of patients who will vomit without antiemetics: high (> 90%); moderate (30-90%); low (10- <30%); minimal/rare (< 10%). See BC Cancer Protocol SCNausea: Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting in Adults. - Frequency for overall (all grades) and severe (grade 3 or 4) side effects are reported when known. It is not always possible to reliably estimate frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure for adverse reactions which are reported through post-marketing or case reports as these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size. - Clinically significant or dose limiting side effects are in bold and italics.	"
"	INTERACTIONS:	"
"	• Information may be limited for drugs which are not yet marketed in Canada. • Focus is primarily on evidence-based interactions. This section may be abbreviated compared to the full CDM monograph. • If available, interaction table includes evidence-based drug-drug, drug-herb, drug-food, and drug-lab interactions. • Interactions due to obvious, simple additive or antagonistic effects based on known pharmacologic activity of the interacting agents are not included.	"
"	4	"
"	• Theoretical interactions may be included below the interaction table if considered potentially clinically significant. • Grapefruit interactions are included; however, interactions with other foods susceptible to interaction (i.e., pomelo, lime, bitter orange, etc.) are not routinely included as this information is not readily available in standard references and the clinical significance is unknown.

"	Bleomycin Associated Lung Toxicity. A Guideline for Oxygen Therapy for Patients who have Received Bleomycin Systemic Therapy.	"
"	Effective date: 27 July 2000 Prepared by: Dr. Judy Sutherland on behalf of GU Tumour Group Approved by: Provincial Systemic Program Committee	"
"	The objective of this guideline is to provide recommendations for oxygen therapy based on the quality of available published evidence relating bleomycin pulmonary toxicity (BPT) to supplemental oxygen therapy. The diagnosis and treatment of BPT have been reviewed elsewhere and will not be reported in this guideline. A MEDLINE literature search of all published abstracts, case reviews and clinical trials using the search terms ""Bleomycin"" (adverse effects, poisoning, toxicity) and ""Lung diseases"" (chemically induced) was undertaken. Documents retrieved were limited to those published in English and related to human exposure. Seventy-three publications since 1970 were identified and reviewed. The strength of the data were graded according to standard criteria.	"
"	1	"
"	Bleomycin has been used in combination chemotherapy for patients with germ cell tumours, Hodgkin’s disease and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma for more than 20 years. Overall response rates of 50-90% have been achieved. Reported toxicities have included mucositis, hypersensitivity reactions, skin rashes and BPT. 2-4 The reported incidence of non fatal BPT is dependent on the diagnostic criteria used but appears to be 5-10% and fatal BPT has been reported in approximately 2% of treated cases. 5,6 Pulmonary toxicity may occur in the form of acute pneumonitis, chronic pulmonary fibrosis or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which is most commonly seen in the postoperative setting. 7,8 Risk factors that have been associated with BPT include age >40 years, cumulative dose of >450 units, renal failure, concomitant administration of cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and doxorubicin, chest irradiation, and positive fluid balance during prolonged surgical procedures. 5,6 Animal studies have demonstrated that supplemental oxygen may be an additional risk factor for lung toxicity	"
"	9	"
"	, but human data based on case reports, and retrospective reviews are less clear. Multivariate analyses in two large retrospective reviews have not identified high flow oxygen as an additional risk factor for BPT. 10,11 Prospective randomized studies evaluating pulmonary morbidity in bleomycin treated patients have not been reported.	"
"	The vast majority of the data relating BPT to oxygen therapy has been obtained from patients undergoing general anesthesia and surgical resections following chemotherapy with multiagent regimens containing bleomycin. Very little published data are available reporting the safety of chronic or short-term supplemental oxygen in non-surgical patients who have received bleomycin. In 1978, Goldiner et al. published the first report of postanesthetic complications in patients who received bleomycin for germ cell tumours and later underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection or resection of pulmonary metastases. 7 Five patients died of rapidly progressive respiratory failure. In a subsequent prospective study of 12 similar patients, the mean FIO2 was reduced to 0.24 from 0.39 and the crystalloid administration was significantly reduced from 5.86 mg/kg/h to 3.87. These patients experienced no postoperative pulmonary complications. Goldiner et al. concluded that the FIO2 during and after surgery should be kept as low as possible and that fluid status should be closely monitored to avoid excessive crystalloid administration. 7 These recommendations for anesthetic management remain the guidelines used by most anesthesiologists today. 12 Several similar case studies have been reported. 8,13 Other investigators attribute the absence of postoperative complications to the administration of a low FIO2 and limited fluids.	"
"	14	"
"	Contrary to these recommendations, several more recent publications, which have reviewed over 300 patients undergoing general anesthesia following bleomycin containing regimens for germ cell tumors, have indicated no excess in pulmonary toxicity related to intraoperative or postoperative oxygen therapy. 10,11,15 There has been no substantial change in the anesthetic guidelines for these patients, despite the data obtained from these more recent studies. Several of these investigators have stressed that safe anesthesia for these patients may demand high flow oxygen to avoid risk of intraoperative hypoxia, particularly when one lung anesthesia and ventilation is required for lobectomy.	"
"	12,16	"
"	Published data regarding the safety of exposure to high flow oxygen during recreational activities such as scuba diving are limited and patients should be counselled that safety cannot be assured during these activities.	"

"	Implementation of this guideline may reduce treatment-related morbidity and mortality. The magnitude of the benefit is expected to be modest given the overall low rate of BPT in current clinical practice. The success of this guideline should be evaluated by careful reporting of treatment-related toxicity in all at risk patients as it is unlikely that prospective clinical trials will be done.	"
"	RECOMMENDATIONS 1. The conflicting evidence suggests that caution regarding oxygen therapy be continued, but that patients should not be denied oxygen therapy if hypoxia is documented or anticipated. 2. If supplemental oxygen is required, the lowest FIO2 that maintains adequate tissue oxygenation (as measured by arterial blood gasses or pulse oximetry) should be provided. 3. Preoperative anesthesia consultation should be mandatory for patients with a history of bleomycin therapy. 4. Recreational use of high flow oxygen (e.g., scuba diving) should be discouraged. 5. Patients should be encouraged to carry wallet cards or wrist bracelets alerting caregivers to possible toxicity associated with oxygen therapy.	"

"	Methotrexate-induced pulmonary toxicity can be acute, subacute, or chronic. 23 Patients who experience pulmonary toxicity will often develop this within the first year of methotrexate therapy, but it can occur much earlier or much later. 23 Subacute toxicity is the most common and includes dyspnea, non-productive cough, fever, crackles, cyanosis, pulmonary fibrosis, pleural effusions. 23 Treatment includes discontinuing methotrexate and initiating corticosteroid therapy. 23 Improvement can occur within days of stopping methotrexate; rechallenging with the drug is not recommended.	"

"	Acute renal failure: High-dose methotrexate-induced renal failure is a medical emergency because methotrexate is mainly eliminated by the kidneys. 26 Renal damage is due to precipitation of methotrexate in the tubules and to tubule injury. Drug precipitation can often be prevented by hydration and alkalization of the urine. 8 Hydration produces a high urine output and lowers the concentration of methotrexate in the tubular fluid; alkalization of the urine increases the solubility of methotrexate. During the recovery period sustained methotrexate levels may result in substantial bone marrow and gastrointestinal toxicity. 19 Management should include continued monitoring of methotrexate levels, administration of leucovorin (see leucovorin rescue) and alkalinized intravenous fluids until plasma levels fall below 0.05 micromol/L.

"	Glucarpidase can be used to treat patients at risk for methotrexate toxicity secondary to delayed elimination 27 and is available through the Health Canada Special Access Programme:  Glucarpidase 50 units/kg IV over 5 minutes	"
"	27	"
"	- For methotrexate level > 100 micromol/L, may give second dose of glucarpidase 48 hours after administration of first dose.	"
"	32	"
"	 High-dose leucovorin (eg, 1000 mg/m2 IV every 6 hours) should be given prior to the receipt and administration of glucarpidase.	"
"	32	"
"	- Leucovorin should be given at least 2-4 hours before or after administration of glucarpidase.	"
"	27	"
"	- After administration of glucarpidase, leucovorin should be continued at a high dose of 250 mg/m2 IV every 6 hours for a total of 48 hours; after that time, leucovorin rescue should be modified based on methotrexate levels and clinical signs of toxicity.	"
"	32	"
"	- Note that following glucarpidase administration, methotrexate level based on standard clinical immunoassay methods may be artificially high due to interference from high levels of DAMPA.	"
"	27	"
"	Neurologic complications 24 : Methotrexate-induced neurotoxicities can be seen with intrathecal injection of methotrexate and with high-dose methotrexate. 4 The neurotoxicities may be due to the accumulation of adenosine resulting from the inhibition of purine synthesis.	"
"	20	"
"	For Intrathecal (IT) administration  Aseptic meningitis 24 : This is the most common toxicity seen with IT administration (10%); includes headache, neck rigidity, back pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and lethargy. Aseptic meningitis can begin 2-4 hours after the drug is injected, and can last 12-72 hours. There is usually no treatment required; the risk of developing this can be decreased by the administration of IT hydrocortisone, or oral corticosteroids. Patients may be rechallenged.  Transverse myelopathy	"
"	24	"
"	: This is much less common 24 ; includes isolated spinal cord dysfunction over hours or days. Transverse myelopathy can begin between 30 minutes and 48 hours after treatment. This is more common with concurrent radiotherapy or frequent IT injections of methotrexate. Recovery from this condition is variable. Patients are not rechallenged.  Leukoencephalopathy 24 : This can be a delayed complication and is more common in patients receiving whole brain radiotherapy or previous IV methotrexate. Symptoms include confusion, irritability, somnolence, ataxia, dementia, and occasionally seizures and coma.	"
"	5	"
"	 Encephalopathy, seizures, neurologic deficits, lumbosacral radiculopathy, neurogenic pulmonary edema, and sudden death can rarely occur.	"
"	24	"
"	For high-dose methotrexate (> 1000 mg/m 2 )  Acute neurotoxicity	"
"	24	"
"	: includes somnolence, confusion, and seizures within 24 hours of treatment. These usually resolve spontaneously; rechallenge is possible.  Subacute neurotoxicity	"
"	24	"
"	: seen with weekly or every two week administration. “Stroke-like” syndrome, including transient neurologic deficits, confusion, and seizures. Occurring about 6 days after drug administration, lasting from 15 minutes to 72 hours and then resolving. Rechallenge is possible.  Leukoencephalopathy, see above.	"
"	Hyperuricemia may result from cell lysis by cytotoxic chemotherapy and may lead to electrolyte disturbances or acute renal failure. 33 It is most likely with highly proliferative tumours of massive burden, such as leukemias, high- grade lymphomas, and myeloproliferative diseases. The risk may be increased in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction, especially ureteral obstruction. Suggested prophylactic treatment for high-risk patients 34 : • aggressive hydration: 3 L/m²/24 hr with target urine output >100 ml/h • if possible, discontinue drugs that cause hyperuricemia (e.g., thiazide diuretics) or acidic urine (e.g., salicylates) • monitor electrolytes, calcium, phosphate, renal function, LDH, and uric acid q6h x 24-48 hours • replace electrolytes as required • allopurinol 600 mg po initially, then 300 mg po q6h x6 doses, then 300 mg po daily x 5-7 days	"
"	Urine should be alkalinized only if the uric acid level is elevated, using sodium bicarbonate IV or PO titrated to maintain urine pH>7. Rasburicase (FASTURTEC®) is a novel uricolytic agent that catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to a water-soluble metabolite, removing the need for alkalinization of the urine. 35 It may be used for treatment or	"

"	List of Antidepressants and Tamoxifen Interactions	"
"	(Developed by BCCA Provincial Drug Information Service, in collaboration with the Breast Tumour Group and Vancouver Cancer Centre psychiatrists).	"
"	Tamoxifen is converted into its active metabolites 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen, endoxifen and other active metabolites by the CYP2D6 liver enzyme. The efficacy of tamoxifen may vary between individuals due to heterogeneous genetic variation in CYP2D6 activity, and by co-administration of a number of drugs that may modulate the activity of the enzyme.	"
"	Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI's) are a commonly used class of anti depressants which inhibit CYP2D6 to varying degrees. Concurrent administration of some SSRIs and tamoxifen has been shown to lower levels of endoxifen, but not of 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen. The clinical implications of this decline in endoxifen levels are unclear because tamoxifen concentrations do not appear to change substantially. However, retrospective evidence presented at ASCO 2009 reported that concomitant use of tamoxifen and moderate/potent CYP2D6 inhibitors significantly increased the risk of breast cancer recurrence. In the SSRI subanalysis, moderate or potent, CYP2D6 inhibitors were associated with 25-92% greater relative risk of breast cancer recurrence, depending on duration of co-exposure, compared with taking no SSRIs with tamoxifen. Weak CYP2D6 inhibitors were not associated with an increased breast cancer recurrence in this study. A recent retrospective study from Ontario also suggests that the greater risk of breast cancer recurrence with paroxetine may be associated with increased cancer death.	"
"	Drugs that could potentially cause reduction in efficacy and thus should be used with caution include any strong CYP2D6 inhibitors such as: fluoxetine, paroxetine, chlorpromazine, miconazole, quinidine, and bupropion. Moderate inhibitors include: ketoconazole, trazodone and amiodarone. The safest course of action is to avoid co- administration of tamoxifen and any of these medications. However, each individual’s particular need and circumstances should be evaluated to determine what is best for them.	"
"	Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRI's) like venlaflaxine and desvenlafaxine are weak CYP2D6 inhibitors and do not lower the concentration of endoxifen. These are better choices for women taking tamoxifen who also require medication for depression or relief of hot flashes.	"
"	The following table lists examples of commonly used antidepressants and their association with CYP2D6 and tamoxifen. NOTE: The following table is not an all-inclusive list and the contents are subject to change over time. Therefore, this table is not intended to be used as the sole source of information regarding antidepressant-tamoxifen interactions and should always be used in conjunction with standard drug interaction resources.

"	Interim monographs and patient handouts may be provided for non-benefit drugs which are available at BC Cancer through the BC Cancer Compassionate Access Program (CAP). Interim monographs may also be provided for parenteral non-benefit drugs which are not yet marketed in Canada but are accessible through the Health Canada Special Access Program (SAP) and approved for use at BC Cancer through CAP. In some cases, these drugs may be supplied by companies outside of Canada.	"
"	Interim monographs are limited in scope and will mainly provide information that is necessary to ensure safe preparation and administration of the drug at BC Cancer (e.g., dosing, preparation, administration, and toxicity). See BC Cancer Policy III-90: Parenteral Drug Therapy Policy. Some sections of the interim documents may be abbreviated or omitted as compared to the full drug monograph, particularly if prepared in an expedited fashion for a specific CAP request. Refer to the CAP approval by which a patient is being treated.	"
"	Each interim drug monograph contains the following sections:	"
"	DRUG NAME:	"
"	• Depending on the country of origin, generic name will be listed as per the approved monograph from Health Canada, US Food and Drug Administration, or European Medicines Agency as applicable or, if not yet marketed, from the available product information.	"
"	SYNONYM(S):	"
"	• Includes alternate generic names used in Canada and the US (if applicable).	"
"	COMMON TRADE NAME(S):	"
"	• Trade names used in Canada and the US (if available).	"
"	CLASSIFICATION:	"
"	• General pharmacologic classification.	"
"	MECHANISM OF ACTION:	"
"	• Brief description of the mechanism of action to provide the rationale for drug choice and to help predict the effect and toxicity of a drug.	"
"	USES:	"
"	• Includes only malignant conditions that may be treated with this drug. • Health Canada approved indications and common off label indications may be included (if applicable).	"
"	• NOTE: Inclusion of an indication in this section does NOT imply that it is a BC Cancer approved	"
"	indication.	"
"	SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS:	"
"	• Includes special considerations for identifying patients who should NOT receive a drug or should receive it with cautions or dose adjustment. • May be abbreviated compared to the full CDM monograph and may not contain information about carcinogenicity, pregnancy, fertility, etc.	"
"	SIDE EFFECTS:	"
"	• Focus is primarily on acute reactions. • Includes adverse events that may present during drug treatment but do not necessarily have a causal relationship with the drug, as well as adverse reactions that are suspected to be related to the drug.	"
"	1,2	"
